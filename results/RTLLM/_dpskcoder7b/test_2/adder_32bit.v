     // The Carry-Lookahead Adder block should be instantiated 16 times 
     // to handle the 32-bit addition

     // The Carry-Lookahead Adder block should have the following ports:
     //   A[15:0], B[15:0], C_IN, S[15:0], C_OUT

     // The carry-out C32 of the adder_32bit module should be the carry-out 
     // of the last Carry-Lookahead Adder block

     // The sum S[32:1] of the adder_32bit module should be the sum 
     // of all the Carry-Lookahead Adder blocks

     // The 16 bit CLA block is not provided here. 
     // You need to design it first and then use it here.
