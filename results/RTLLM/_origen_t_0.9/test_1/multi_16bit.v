Please implement the complete Verilog code module for the unsigned 16-bit multiplier with the provided description and input/output ports. The module should utilize shift and accumulate operations for multiplication and include control signals for the operation. The reset functionality, shift and accumulate operations, and the assignment of the product output should be included as well.

Module name:  
    multi_16bit  

Input ports:
    clk: Chip clock signal.
    rst_n: Active-low reset signal. Defined as 0 for chip reset and 1 for reset signal inactive.
    start: Chip enable signal to initiate the multiplication operation.
    ain: Input signal representing the multiplicand (a) with a data width of 16 bits.
    bin: Input signal representing the multiplier (b) with a data width of 16 bits.

Output ports:
    yout: Product output signal with a data width of 32 bits.
    done: Chip output flag signal. Defined as 1 indicates the completion of the multiplication operation.

Implementation:
Data bit control:
On every positive edge of the clock signal (clk) or the falling edge of the reset signal (rst_n), the shift count register (i) is updated.
If the reset signal (rst_n) is low, indicating a reset condition, the shift count register (i) is set to 0.
If the start signal is active (start) and the shift count register (i) is less than 17, the shift count register (i) increments by 1.
If the start signal is inactive (!start), the shift count register (i) is reset to 0.
Multiplication completion flag generation:
On every positive edge of the clock signal (clk) or the falling edge of the reset signal (rst_n), the multiplication completion flag (done_r) is updated.
If the reset signal (rst_n) is low, the multiplication completion flag (done_r) is set to 0.
If the shift count register (i) is equal to 16, indicating the completion of the multiplication operation, the multiplication completion flag (done_r) is set to 1.
If the shift count register (i) is equal to 17, the multiplication completion flag (done_r) is reset to 0.
Shift and accumulate operation:
On every positive edge of the clock signal (clk) or the falling edge of the reset signal (rst_n), the module performs the shift and accumulate operation.
If the reset signal (rst_n) is low, indicating a reset condition, the multiplicand register (areg), multiplier register (breg), and product register (yout_r) are reset to 0.
If the start signal is active (start), the module starts the multiplication operation.
When the shift count register (i) is 0, the multiplicand (ain) and multiplier (bin) are stored in the respective registers (areg and breg).
For shift counts greater than 0 and less than 17, if the bit at position i-1 in the multiplicand register (areg) is high, the product register (yout_r) accumulates the shifted value of the multiplier register (breg) by shifting it left by i-1 positions and appending zeros at the least significant bit positions.
Output assignment:
The product output (yout) is assigned the value of the product register (yout_r).
