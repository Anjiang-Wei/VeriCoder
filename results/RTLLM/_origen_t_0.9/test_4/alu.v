Your implementation should include:
- Assigning the input operands to signed wires.
- Assigning the output result (r) to the lower 32 bits of the register (res).
- Determining the value of the flag based on the control signal.
- Using a case statement to perform the appropriate operation based on the control signal.
- Assigning the result to the register (res) based on the operation performed.
- Assigning the zero output when the result is all zeros.
- Determining the overflow, carry, and negative outputs based on the operation performed.

Please make sure to implement the logic for all the specified operations and provide a complete Verilog module.
