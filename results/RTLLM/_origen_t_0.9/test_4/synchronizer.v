The Verilog code for the synchronizer module should be implemented as described. The module should utilize registers to store the input data and control signals, implementing the functionality for the multi-bit MUX-based synchronizer. The data register and enable data register should be updated based on the respective clock signals and reset signals. The enable control registers should be updated based on the enable data register, and the output data should be assigned based on the control signal and reset signal. Ensure that the complete module code adheres to the functionality described in the problem.
