The given code snippet is incomplete. Please complete it according to the following requirements:
1. Implement the parallel-to-serial conversion as described.
2. Use the clk and rst_n signals to control the synchronous operations.
3. Ensure that the output signals valid_out and dout are generated as described.

Your implementation should be clear and concise, focusing on the specific functionality of the parallel-to-serial conversion.
