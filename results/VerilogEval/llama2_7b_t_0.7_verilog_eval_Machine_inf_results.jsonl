The data output is used to output the data that is being processed by the module, and the valid output is used to indicate when the data output is valid.  \tThe top module also contains two internal signals, a state and a counter. The state is used to keep track of the current state of the module, and the counter is used to keep track of the number of clock cycles that have passed since the last reset.  \tThe top module is a finite state machine (FSM).

The inputs are a clock (clk), an asynchronous reset (areset), a load signal (load), an enable signal (ena), and a 4-bit data input (data). The output is a 4-bit register (q).  The module is always sensitive to the rising edge of the clock and the asynchronous reset. When the asynchronous reset is active, the output register is set to 0. When the load signal is active, the data input is loaded into the output register. When the enable signal is active, the output register is shifted left by 1 bit.

Provide the Verilog code design directly.\n\n The top Verilog module is a simple state machine with two states, A and B. It has four inputs: clk, in, reset, and out, and one output, out. The clk input is used to trigger the state machine, the in input is used to determine which state to transition to, the reset input is used to reset the state machine to the initial state, and the out output is used to indicate the current state.  The module is implemented using a parameterized register, state, and a combinational logic block. The parameterized register, state, is used to store the current state of the state machine. The combinational logic block is used to determine the next state of the state machine based on the current state and the in input. If the current state is A, the next state will be A if the in input is high, and B if the in input is low. If the current state is B, the next state will be B if the in input is high, and A if the in input is low.  The module also contains an always block triggered on the rising edge of the clk input. This block is used to update the state register with the next state determined by the combinational logic block. If the reset input is high, the state register is reset to the initial state, B. Otherwise, the state register is updated with the next state determined by the combinational logic block.  Finally, the out output is assigned the value of the state register.

The clock input (clk) is used to synchronize the circuit and the other two inputs (j and k) are used to control the state of the output (Q).   The module is declared with the keyword \"module\" followed by the name of the module (\"top\") and the list of ports (inputs and outputs). The module body contains an always block, which is triggered on the rising edge of the clock signal (posedge clk). Inside the always block, the output (Q) is assigned a value based on the logic expression given. The expression is a combination of two logic operations, an AND operation and an OR operation. The AND operation is between the input j and the NOT of the output Q, and the OR operation is between the NOT of the input k and the output Q.   This expression implements the JK flip-flop logic. When the input j is high and the input k is low, the output Q will be set to the value of j. When the input j is low and the input k is high, the output Q will be reset to the value of 0. When both the inputs j and k are high, the output Q will toggle its value.

It has four ports: two inputs (ring and vibrate_mode) and two outputs (ringer and motor).   The ring input is a signal that is used to indicate when the device should be ringing or vibrating. The vibrate_mode input is a signal that indicates whether the device should be ringing or vibrating.   The ringer output is a signal that is used to control the ringer of the device. It is set to 1 when the device should be ringing and 0 when it should not be ringing. The motor output is a signal that is used to control the motor of the device. It is set to 1 when the device should be vibrating and 0 when it should not be vibrating.   The module uses two assign statements to control the ringer and motor outputs. The first assign statement sets the ringer output to the logical AND of the ring and the logical NOT of the vibrate_mode inputs. This means that the ringer output will be set to 1 when the ring input is 1 and the vibrate_mode input is 0, and it will be set to 0 otherwise.   The second assign statement sets the motor output to the logical AND of the ring and the vibrate_mode inputs.

The clock input is used to control when the data input is stored in the register. When the clock input goes from low to high, the data input is stored in the register and is output on the data output.   The module starts with an initial block which sets the output to a default value of 8'h0. This is the value that the register will output until the clock input is triggered.

It then assigns the 8-bit output, s, to the 8 least significant bits of the sum. Finally, it assigns the overflow output to a logical expression which checks if the two inputs have the same sign and if the sign of the output is different from the sign of the inputs. If both of these conditions are true, then the overflow bit is set to 1, otherwise it is set to 0.\nPlease complete the Verilog code below and return the complete module code.

The out_sop output is generated by taking the logical AND of input c and d, and then taking the logical OR of the result with the logical AND of the logical NOT of input a, the logical NOT of input b, and input c.   The out_pos output is generated by first taking the logical AND of inputs c, the logical OR of the logical NOT of input b and input d, and the logical OR of the logical NOT of input a and input b. This result is assigned to the wire pos0. Then, the same logical AND is done, but with the logical OR of the logical NOT of input a and input d. This result is assigned to the wire pos1.

Provide the Verilog code design directly.\n\n The top Verilog module is a simple state machine with two states, A and B. It has four inputs: clk, in, reset, and out, and one output, out. The clk input is used to trigger the state machine, the in input is used to determine which state to transition to, the reset input is used to reset the state machine to the initial state, and the out output is used to indicate the current state.  The module is implemented using a parameterized register, state, and a combinational logic block. The parameterized register, state, is used to store the current state of the state machine. The combinational logic block is used to determine the next state of the state machine based on the current state and the in input. If the current state is A, the next state will be A if the in input is high, and B if the in input is low. If the current state is B, the next state will be B if the in input is high, and A if the in input is low.  The module also contains an always block triggered on the rising edge of the clk input. This block is used to update the state register with the next state determined by the combinational logic block. If the reset input is high, the state register is reset to the initial state, B. Otherwise, the state register is updated with the next state determined by the combinational logic block.  Finally, the out output is assigned the value of the state register. If the state register is B, the out output will be high, otherwise it will be low.\nPlease complete the Verilog code below and return the complete module code.

The inputs to the module are a clock signal (clk), a reset signal (resetn), and a 3-bit vector (r). The outputs of the module are a 3-bit vector (g).   The module has a register, state, that stores the current state of the machine. The register is updated on the rising edge of the clock signal.

The module begins by declaring the four ports, two inputs (a and b) and two outputs (sum and cout). The assign statement then assigns the two outputs to the result of the addition of the two inputs. The addition is done using the + operator, which adds the two inputs together and produces the sum output and the carry out, which is stored in the cout output.

It has an input clock (clk) and an asynchronous reset (areset) to control the module. It also has inputs for the prediction valid signal (predict_valid) and the prediction taken signal (predict_taken). The output of the module is the predict_history signal, which is a 32-bit vector that stores the history of the branch predictions.  The module also has inputs for the training signals, which are used to update the predict_history signal. The train_mispredicted signal indicates whether the previous prediction was mispredicted, while the train_taken signal indicates whether the branch was taken or not. The train_history signal is a 32-bit vector that stores the history of the actual branch instructions.  The module works by always checking the clock and reset signals. If the reset signal is asserted, the predict_history signal is reset to 0. If the reset signal is not asserted, the module checks the train_mispredicted and predict_valid signals.

It has four ports: a clock (clk) input, a data (d) input, a reset input, and a data (q) output. The clock input is used to synchronize the register, the data input is used to set the value of the register, the reset input is used to reset the register to 0, and the data output is used to read the value of the register.   The module is implemented using an always block that is triggered by the rising edge of the clock signal. When the reset input is high, the output q is set to 0.

The module is always sensitive to the rising edge of the clock and the asynchronous reset. When the asynchronous reset is active, the output register is set to 0. When the load signal is active, the data input is loaded into the output register. When the enable signal is active, the output register is shifted left by 1 bit. When none of the signals are active, the output register remains unchanged.\nPlease complete the Verilog code below and return the complete module code.

Provide the Verilog code design directly.\n\n The top Verilog module is a simple state machine with two states, A and B. It has four inputs: clk, in, reset, and out, and one output, out. The clk input is used to trigger the state machine, the in input is used to determine which state to transition to, the reset input is used to reset the state machine to the initial state, and the out output is used to indicate the current state.  The module is implemented using a parameterized register, state, and a combinational logic block. The parameterized register, state, is used to store the current state of the state machine. The combinational logic block is used to determine the next state of the state machine based on the current state and the in input. If the current state is A, the next state will be A if the in input is high, and B if the in input is low. If the current state is B, the next state will be B if the in input is high, and A if the in input is low.  The module also contains an always block triggered on the rising edge of the clk input. This block is used to update the state register with the next state determined by the combinational logic block. If the reset input is high, the state register is reset to the initial state, B. Otherwise, the state register is updated with the next state determined by the combinational logic block.  Finally, the out output is assigned the value of the state register.

Provide the Verilog code design directly.\n\n This top Verilog module is a state machine that outputs a one-bit signal z. The module has four ports: a clock (clk), a reset (reset), an input (w), and an output (z). The module has six states, A to F. The next state of the state machine is determined by the current state and the input w. The transition from state A to state B is taken when the input w is low. The transition from state A to state A is taken when the input w is high. The transition from state B to state D is taken when the input w is high. The transition from state B to state C is taken when the input w is low. The transition from state C to state D is taken when the input w is high. The transition from state C to state E is taken when the input w is low. The transition from state D to state A is taken when the input w is high. The transition from state D to state F is taken when the input w is low. The transition from state E to state D is taken when the input w is high. The transition from state E to state E is taken when the input w is low. The transition from state F to state D is taken when the input w is high. The transition from state F to state C is taken when the input w is low.  The state machine is triggered by the clk signal. When the clk signal is high, the state machine will check the reset signal.

The module has 6 ports: clk, areset, bump_left, bump_right, walk_left, and walk_right. The clk port is an input port that is used to synchronize the state machine. The areset port is an input port that is used to reset the state machine to the initial state. The bump_left and bump_right ports are input ports that indicate whether the robot has bumped into an obstacle on the left or right side. The walk_left and walk_right ports are output ports that indicate the walking direction of the robot.  The module has two parameters, WL and WR, which represent the two states of the state machine. The state machine is implemented using a register, state, and a combinational logic block. The combinational logic block is used to determine the next state of the state machine based on the current state and the bump_left and bump_right inputs. If the current state is WL, the next state will be WR if the bump_left input is high, and WL if the bump_left input is low. Similarly, if the current state is WR, the next state will be WL if the bump_right input is high, and WR if the bump_right input is low.

The top module is the module that is being tested.  \tThe top module contains two inputs, a clock and a reset. The clock is used to synchronize the logic of the module. The reset is used to reset the state of the module. The module also contains two outputs, a data output and a valid output. The data output is used to output the data that is being processed by the module, and the valid output is used to indicate when the data output is valid.  \tThe top module also contains two internal signals, a state and a counter. The state is used to keep track of the current state of the module, and the counter is used to keep track of the number of clock cycles that have passed since the last reset.  \tThe top module is a finite state machine (FSM). The FSM has four states: idle, wait, process, and done. The idle state is the initial state of the module, and is entered when the reset signal is asserted. In the idle state, the counter is reset to 0 and the data output is set to 0.  \tWhen the clock signal is asserted, the FSM transitions to the wait state. In the wait state, the counter is incremented and the data output is set to 0. The FSM remains in the wait state until the counter reaches a certain threshold, at which point it transitions to the process state.  \tIn the process state, the data output is set to the data that is being processed by the module. The FSM then transitions to the done state. In the done state, the valid output is asserted to indicate that the data output is valid.

The clk input is used to trigger the state machine, the in input is used to determine which state to transition to, the reset input is used to reset the state machine to the initial state, and the out output is used to indicate the current state.  The module is implemented using a parameterized register, state, and a combinational logic block. The parameterized register, state, is used to store the current state of the state machine. The combinational logic block is used to determine the next state of the state machine based on the current state and the in input. If the current state is A, the next state will be A if the in input is high, and B if the in input is low. If the current state is B, the next state will be B if the in input is high, and A if the in input is low.  The module also contains an always block triggered on the rising edge of the clk input. This block is used to update the state register with the next state determined by the combinational logic block. If the reset input is high, the state register is reset to the initial state, B.

The inputs to the module are a clock signal (clk), a reset signal (resetn), and a 3-bit vector (r). The outputs of the module are a 3-bit vector (g).   The module has a register, state, that stores the current state of the machine. The register is updated on the rising edge of the clock signal. If the reset signal is low, the state register is set to A. Otherwise, the state register is set to the value of the next register.  The next register stores the next state of the machine.

The clock input (clk) is used to synchronize the circuit and the other two inputs (j and k) are used to control the state of the output (Q).   The module is declared with the keyword \"module\" followed by the name of the module (\"top\") and the list of ports (inputs and outputs). The module body contains an always block, which is triggered on the rising edge of the clock signal (posedge clk). Inside the always block, the output (Q) is assigned a value based on the logic expression given. The expression is a combination of two logic operations, an AND operation and an OR operation. The AND operation is between the input j and the NOT of the output Q, and the OR operation is between the NOT of the input k and the output Q.   This expression implements the JK flip-flop logic. When the input j is high and the input k is low, the output Q will be set to the value of j. When the input j is low and the input k is high, the output Q will be reset to the value of 0.

The vibrate_mode input is a signal that indicates whether the device should be ringing or vibrating.   The ringer output is a signal that is used to control the ringer of the device. It is set to 1 when the device should be ringing and 0 when it should not be ringing. The motor output is a signal that is used to control the motor of the device. It is set to 1 when the device should be vibrating and 0 when it should not be vibrating.   The module uses two assign statements to control the ringer and motor outputs. The first assign statement sets the ringer output to the logical AND of the ring and the logical NOT of the vibrate_mode inputs. This means that the ringer output will be set to 1 when the ring input is 1 and the vibrate_mode input is 0, and it will be set to 0 otherwise.

The output z is a signal that is set to 1 when a rising edge is detected on the x input.  The module has a parameter, A and B, which are used to define the two states of the state machine. The state of the state machine is stored in a register called state. The state machine is clocked by the posedge of the clk input. When the areset input is asserted, the state is set to A. When the areset input is not asserted, the state is determined by the case statement. If the state is A, then the state will be set to B if the x input is 1, otherwise the state will remain A. If the state is B, then the state will remain B.  The output z is set to 1 when the state is A and the x input is 1, or when the state is B and the x input is 0. Otherwise, the output z is 0.\nPlease complete the Verilog code below and return the complete module code.

If the current state is S1, and the data input is high, the next state will be S11. If the data input is low, the next state will be S. If the current state is S11, and the data input is high, the next state will be S11. If the data input is low, the next state will be S110. If the current state is S110, and the data input is high, the next state will be Done. If the data input is low, the next state will be S. If the current state is Done, the next state will be Done.  The state machine is updated on the rising edge of the clk signal, and is reset to the initial state (S) on the rising edge of the reset signal. The output of the state machine is assigned based on the current state of the state machine. The output will be high if the state is Done, and low otherwise.\n\n\n\nPlease complete the Verilog code below and return the complete module code.

This block is a type of logic block that is used to describe combinational logic. This block is triggered whenever the input signals change.   The always_comb block contains a for loop. This loop iterates over the output bits and assigns each bit to the corresponding bit in the input, but in reverse order. The $bits() function is used to determine the number of bits in the output. This allows the module to be used for inputs and outputs of any size.   The input and output of the module are connected to the input and output ports of the module. The input port is connected to the in signal, and the output port is connected to the out signal. The in signal is a 100-bit input, and the out signal is a 100-bit output.   This module is used to reverse the order of the bits in the input. The output is a reversed version of the input, with the most significant bit of the input becoming the least significant bit of the output, and the least significant bit of the input becoming the most significant bit of the output.\nPlease complete the Verilog code below and return the complete module code. Your code should start with:\n```verilog\n", "prompt": "module top_module (\n\tinput [99:0] in,\n\toutput reg [99:0] out\n);\n", "completion": "module top_module (\n    input [99:0] in,\n    output reg [99:0] out\n);\n\nalways_comb begin\n    for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) begin\n        out[i] <= in[100-i];\n    end\nend\n\nendmodule"}

The module has four inputs: clk, slowena, reset, and four outputs: q. The clk input is a clock signal used to synchronize the counter. The slowena input is an enable signal that must be asserted for the counter to increment. The reset input is an asynchronous reset signal that resets the counter to 0 when asserted.

The inputs are a clock signal (clk), a select signal (L), and two data inputs (q_in and r_in). The output is a single bit register (Q).  The module is triggered on the rising edge of the clock signal. When the clock signal is high, the logic circuit evaluates the select signal (L). If the select signal is high, the output register (Q) is set to the value of the second data input (r_in). If the select signal is low, the output register (Q) is set to the value of the first data input (q_in).  The initial value of the output register (Q) is set to 0. This ensures that the output register is in a known state before the first rising edge of the clock signal.  The module is useful for selecting between two data inputs based on a select signal.

Provide the Verilog code design directly.\n\n The top Verilog module is a finite state machine (FSM) with two states, A and B. It has five ports: clk, j, k, areset, and out. The clk and areset ports are both inputs, while j, k, and out are outputs. The clk port is used to synchronize the state transitions, while the areset port is used to reset the FSM to its initial state. The j and k ports are used to control the state transitions. The out port is used to indicate the current state of the FSM.   The FSM is implemented using a combinational always block, which is used to determine the next state based on the current state and the values of the j and k ports. If the current state is A, the next state is determined by the value of the j port. If the j port is high, the next state is B, otherwise it is A. Similarly, if the current state is B, the next state is determined by the value of the k port. If the k port is high, the next state is A, otherwise it is B.   The FSM is then implemented using a clocked always block, which is used to update the state of the FSM based on the value of the areset port and the value of the next state. If the areset port is high, the state is reset to A. Otherwise, the state is updated to the value of the next state.   Finally, the out port is used to indicate the current state of the FSM.

The q output is a 4-bit register that holds the current value of the counter.  The module is implemented using an always block. This block is triggered on the rising edge of the clk signal. When the block is triggered, it first checks the reset signal. If the reset signal is asserted, the counter is reset to 0. Otherwise, the counter is incremented by 1. The incremented value is then stored in the q register.\nPlease complete the Verilog code below and return the complete module code.

The combinational logic block is used to determine the next state of the state machine based on the current state and the in input. If the current state is A, the next state will be A if the in input is high, and B if the in input is low. If the current state is B, the next state will be B if the in input is high, and A if the in input is low.  The module also contains an always block triggered on the rising edge of the clk input. This block is used to update the state register with the next state determined by the combinational logic block. If the reset input is high, the state register is reset to the initial state, B. Otherwise, the state register is updated with the next state determined by the combinational logic block.  Finally, the out output is assigned the value of the state register. If the state register is B, the out output will be high, otherwise it will be low.\nPlease complete the Verilog code below and return the complete module code.

The first assign statement sets the ringer output to the logical AND of the ring and the logical NOT of the vibrate_mode inputs. This means that the ringer output will be set to 1 when the ring input is 1 and the vibrate_mode input is 0, and it will be set to 0 otherwise.

This module is used to control the ringer and motor of a device based on the ring and vibrate_mode inputs. When the ring input is 1 and the vibrate_mode input is 0, the ringer output will be set to 1 and the motor output will be set to 0.

If the current state is B, then the next state will be B if the input signal is 1, and C if the input signal is 0.   If the current state is C, then the next state will be D if the input signal is 1, and A if the input signal is 0.   If the current state is D, then the next state will be B if the input signal is 1, and C if the input signal is 0.   The state register is updated on the rising edge of the clock signal, clk, and is reset to state A on the rising edge of the reset signal, areset. The output signal, out, is set to 1 when the state machine is in state D.\nPlease complete the Verilog code below and return the complete module code.

The module has two input signals, a and b, and two output signals, out_assign and out_alwaysblock.   The first output, out_assign, is generated using an assign statement, which assigns the result of the logical AND operation between a and b to out_assign. The second output, out_alwaysblock, is generated using an always block. The always block contains a sensitivity list, which is set to '*', meaning that the block will be triggered whenever any of the variables in the sensitivity list changes. The always block assigns the result of the logical AND operation between a and b to out_alwaysblock.

Provide the Verilog code design directly.\n\n The top Verilog module is a finite state machine (FSM) with two states, A and B. It has five ports: clk, j, k, areset, and out. The clk and areset ports are both inputs, while j, k, and out are outputs. The clk port is used to synchronize the state transitions, while the areset port is used to reset the FSM to its initial state. The j and k ports are used to control the state transitions. The out port is used to indicate the current state of the FSM.   The FSM is implemented using a combinational always block, which is used to determine the next state based on the current state and the values of the j and k ports. If the current state is A, the next state is determined by the value of the j port. If the j port is high, the next state is B, otherwise it is A. Similarly, if the current state is B, the next state is determined by the value of the k port. If the k port is high, the next state is A, otherwise it is B.   The FSM is then implemented using a clocked always block, which is used to update the state of the FSM based on the value of the areset port and the value of the next state. If the areset port is high, the state is reset to A. Otherwise, the state is updated to the value of the next state.   Finally, the out port is used to indicate the current state of the FSM.

The module contains a 4-bit register (sr) which is used to store the data. The register is updated on the positive edge of the clock signal. When the resetn signal is low, the register is reset to all zeros. When the resetn signal is high, the register is shifted left by one bit and the input is loaded into the least significant bit. The output is taken from the most significant bit of the register.\nPlease complete the Verilog code below and return the complete module code.

The module begins by declaring the four ports, two inputs (a and b) and two outputs (sum and cout). The assign statement then assigns the two outputs to the result of the addition of the two inputs. The addition is done using the + operator, which adds the two inputs together and produces the sum output and the carry out, which is stored in the cout output.

It also has inputs for the prediction valid signal (predict_valid) and the prediction taken signal (predict_taken). The output of the module is the predict_history signal, which is a 32-bit vector that stores the history of the branch predictions.  The module also has inputs for the training signals, which are used to update the predict_history signal. The train_mispredicted signal indicates whether the previous prediction was mispredicted, while the train_taken signal indicates whether the branch was taken or not. The train_history signal is a 32-bit vector that stores the history of the actual branch instructions.  The module works by always checking the clock and reset signals. If the reset signal is asserted, the predict_history signal is reset to 0. If the reset signal is not asserted, the module checks the train_mispredicted and predict_valid signals. If the train_mispredicted signal is asserted, the predict_history signal is updated with the train_history and train_taken signals. If the predict_valid signal is asserted, the predict_history signal is updated with the predict_taken signal.\nPlease complete the Verilog code below and return the complete module code.

The clock input is used to control when the data input is stored in the register. When the clock input goes from low to high, the data input is stored in the register and is output on the data output.   The module starts with an initial block which sets the output to a default value of 8'h0. This is the value that the register will output until the clock input is triggered.   The always block is triggered on the rising edge of the clock input. When this happens, the data input is stored in the register and is output on the data output. This allows the data input to be stored and output on the data output.   Overall, this module is a simple 8-bit register with a clock input.

The clk input is the clock signal used to synchronize the state machine, the areset input is the asynchronous reset signal, and the x input is the signal that is being monitored for a rising edge. The output z is a signal that is set to 1 when a rising edge is detected on the x input.  The module has a parameter, A and B, which are used to define the two states of the state machine. The state of the state machine is stored in a register called state. The state machine is clocked by the posedge of the clk input. When the areset input is asserted, the state is set to A. When the areset input is not asserted, the state is determined by the case statement. If the state is A, then the state will be set to B if the x input is 1, otherwise the state will remain A. If the state is B, then the state will remain B.  The output z is set to 1 when the state is A and the x input is 1, or when the state is B and the x input is 0. Otherwise, the output z is 0.\nPlease complete the Verilog code below and return the complete module code.

This module does not have any other ports or logic, so it simply assigns the output port to a constant value of 0. This module is useful for testing, as it can be used to set the output to a known value in order to test the functionality of other modules.\nPlease complete the Verilog code below and return the complete module code.

Provide the Verilog code design directly.\n\n This top module is a combinatorial module that adds up all the bits of the input signal \"in\" and stores the result in the output signal \"out\". The input signal \"in\" is a 255-bit wide vector, and the output signal \"out\" is an 8-bit wide vector.   The module contains an always_comb block, which is a type of block that is used to describe combinatorial logic. Inside the always_comb block, the output signal \"out\" is initialized to 0. Then, a for loop is used to iterate through all the bits of the input signal \"in\". For each bit, the value of \"out\" is incremented by the value of the corresponding bit in the input signal. After the for loop is finished, the output signal \"out\" will contain the sum of all the bits in the input signal.\nPlease complete the Verilog code below and return the complete module code.

Provide the Verilog code design directly.\n\n This Verilog module is used to control the temperature of a room. It has two inputs, mode and fan_on, and three outputs, heater, aircon and fan. The inputs mode and fan_on are used to determine the state of the system, while the outputs heater, aircon and fan are used to control the temperature of the room.  The mode input is used to determine the mode of operation. If mode is high, the system is in heating mode and if mode is low, the system is in cooling mode.  The fan_on input is used to control the fan. If fan_on is high, the fan will be turned on regardless of the mode.  The too_cold and too_hot inputs are used to determine the temperature of the room. If too_cold is high, the room is too cold and if too_hot is high, the room is too hot.  The fan output is used to control the fan. If fan is high, the fan will be turned on. The fan will be turned on if either too_cold or too_hot is high, or if fan_on is high.  The heater output is used to control the heater. If heater is high, the heater will be turned on. The heater will be turned on if mode is high and too_cold is high.  The aircon output is used to control the air conditioner. If aircon is high, the air conditioner will be turned on.

Provide the Verilog code design directly.\n\n This top Verilog module is a state machine that outputs a one-bit signal z. The module has four ports: a clock (clk), a reset (reset), an input (w), and an output (z). The module has six states, A to F. The next state of the state machine is determined by the current state and the input w. The transition from state A to state B is taken when the input w is low. The transition from state A to state A is taken when the input w is high. The transition from state B to state D is taken when the input w is high. The transition from state B to state C is taken when the input w is low. The transition from state C to state D is taken when the input w is high. The transition from state C to state E is taken when the input w is low. The transition from state D to state A is taken when the input w is high. The transition from state D to state F is taken when the input w is low. The transition from state E to state D is taken when the input w is high. The transition from state E to state E is taken when the input w is low. The transition from state F to state D is taken when the input w is high. The transition from state F to state C is taken when the input w is low.  The state machine is triggered by the clk signal. When the clk signal is high, the state machine will check the reset signal. If the reset signal is high, the state machine will reset to state A, otherwise the state machine will transition to the next state. The output z is high when the state machine is in state E or F, and is low otherwise.\n\n\n\nPlease complete the Verilog code below and return the complete module code.
