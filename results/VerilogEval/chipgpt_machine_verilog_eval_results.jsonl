The module is triggered on the rising edge of the clock signal. When the clock signal is high, the logic circuit evaluates the select signal (L). If the select signal is high, the output register (Q) is set to the value of the second data input (r_in). If the select signal is low, the output register (Q) is set to the value of the first data input (q_in).  The initial value of the output register (Q) is set to 0. This ensures that the output register is in a known state before the first rising edge of the clock signal.  The module is useful for selecting between two data inputs based on a select signal.

Provide the Verilog code design directly.\n\n The top Verilog module is a finite state machine (FSM) with two states, A and B. It has five ports: clk, j, k, areset, and out. The clk and areset ports are both inputs, while j, k, and out are outputs. The clk port is used to synchronize the state transitions, while the areset port is used to reset the FSM to its initial state. The j and k ports are used to control the state transitions. The out port is used to indicate the current state of the FSM.   The FSM is implemented using a combinational always block, which is used to determine the next state based on the current state and the values of the j and k ports. If the current state is A, the next state is determined by the value of the j port. If the j port is high, the next state is B, otherwise it is A. Similarly, if the current state is B, the next state is determined by the value of the k port. If the k port is high, the next state is A, otherwise it is B.   The FSM is then implemented using a clocked always block, which is used to update the state of the FSM based on the value of the areset port and the value of the next state. If the areset port is high, the state is reset to A. Otherwise, the state is updated to the value of the next state.   Finally, the out port is used to indicate the current state of the FSM.

The assign statement adds the inputs a and b, plus the carry-in bit, and assigns the result to the outputs cout and sum. The carry-out bit is calculated by determining if the sum of the inputs is greater than or equal to 2. If it is, then the carry-out bit is set to 1, otherwise it is set to 0. The sum output is the result of the addition of a, b, and cin, modulo 2."}

The out_pos output is generated by first taking the logical AND of inputs c, the logical OR of the logical NOT of input b and input d, and the logical OR of the logical NOT of input a and input b. This result is assigned to the wire pos0. Then, the same logical AND is done, but with the logical OR of the logical NOT of input a and input d. This result is assigned to the wire pos1. Finally, the out_pos output is assigned to the result of a ternary expression that checks if pos0 and pos1 are equal, and if so, assigns out_pos to pos0, otherwise assigns out_pos to 1'bx (unknown).\nKeep your reasoning process short and concise.

Provide the Verilog code design directly.\n\n The top Verilog module is a simple state machine with two states, A and B. It has four inputs: clk, in, reset, and out, and one output, out. The clk input is used to trigger the state machine, the in input is used to determine which state to transition to, the reset input is used to reset the state machine to the initial state, and the out output is used to indicate the current state.  The module is implemented using a parameterized register, state, and a combinational logic block. The parameterized register, state, is used to store the current state of the state machine. The combinational logic block is used to determine the next state of the state machine based on the current state and the in input. If the current state is A, the next state will be A if the in input is high, and B if the in input is low. If the current state is B, the next state will be B if the in input is high, and A if the in input is low.  The module also contains an always block triggered on the rising edge of the clk input. This block is used to update the state register with the next state determined by the combinational logic block. If the reset input is high, the state register is reset to the initial state, B. Otherwise, the state register is updated with the next state determined by the combinational logic block.  Finally, the out output is assigned the value of the state register. If the state register is B, the out output will be high, otherwise it will be low.\nKeep your reasoning process short and concise.

The module contains two registers qp and qn. The register qp is always updated with the value of d when the clock signal clk is positive. The register qn is always updated with the value of d when the clock signal clk is negative.   The output port q is assigned the value of either qp or qn depending on the value of clk. If clk is positive, q is assigned the value of qp. If clk is negative, q is assigned the value of qn.

Provide the Verilog code design directly.\n\n The top Verilog module is a simple state machine with two states, A and B. It has four inputs: clk, in, reset, and out, and one output, out. The clk input is used to trigger the state machine, the in input is used to determine which state to transition to, the reset input is used to reset the state machine to the initial state, and the out output is used to indicate the current state.  The module is implemented using a parameterized register, state, and a combinational logic block. The parameterized register, state, is used to store the current state of the state machine. The combinational logic block is used to determine the next state of the state machine based on the current state and the in input. If the current state is A, the next state will be A if the in input is high, and B if the in input is low. If the current state is B, the next state will be B if the in input is high, and A if the in input is low.  The module also contains an always block triggered on the rising edge of the clk input. This block is used to update the state register with the next state determined by the combinational logic block. If the reset input is high, the state register is reset to the initial state, B. Otherwise, the state register is updated with the next state determined by the combinational logic block.  Finally, the out output is assigned the value of the state register. If the state register is B, the out output will be high, otherwise it will be low.\nKeep your reasoning process short and concise.

The areset port is an input port that is used to reset the state machine to the initial state. The bump_left and bump_right ports are input ports that indicate whether the robot has bumped into an obstacle on the left or right side. The walk_left and walk_right ports are output ports that indicate the walking direction of the robot.  The module has two parameters, WL and WR, which represent the two states of the state machine. The state machine is implemented using a register, state, and a combinational logic block. The combinational logic block is used to determine the next state of the state machine based on the current state and the bump_left and bump_right inputs. If the current state is WL, the next state will be WR if the bump_left input is high, and WL if the bump_left input is low. Similarly, if the current state is WR, the next state will be WL if the bump_right input is high, and WR if the bump_right input is low.  The state machine is updated on the rising edge of the clk signal, and is reset to the initial state (WL) on the rising edge of the areset signal. The walk_left and walk_right outputs are assigned based on the current state of the state machine. If the state is WL, the walk_left output will be high and the walk_right output will be low. If the state is WR, the walk_left output will be low and the walk_right output will be high.\nKeep your reasoning process short and concise.

Provide the Verilog code design directly.\n\n The top Verilog module is a state machine that has 4 states, A, B, C, and D. The inputs to the module are a clock signal (clk), a reset signal (resetn), and a 3-bit vector (r). The outputs of the module are a 3-bit vector (g).   The module has a register, state, that stores the current state of the machine. The register is updated on the rising edge of the clock signal. If the reset signal is low, the state register is set to A. Otherwise, the state register is set to the value of the next register.  The next register stores the next state of the machine. It is updated in the always block. The logic for the next register is a case statement that depends on the current state and the 3-bit vector, r. If the current state is A, then the next state is determined by the value of r. If r[1] is high, then the next state is B. If r[2] is high, then the next state is C. If r[3] is high, then the next state is D. If none of the bits of r are high, then the next state is A.

The module is triggered on the rising edge of the clock signal. When the clock signal is high, the logic circuit evaluates the select signal (L). If the select signal is high, the output register (Q) is set to the value of the second data input (r_in). If the select signal is low, the output register (Q) is set to the value of the first data input (q_in).  The initial value of the output register (Q) is set to 0. This ensures that the output register is in a known state before the first rising edge of the clock signal.  The module is useful for selecting between two data inputs based on a select signal.

The clk and areset ports are both inputs, while j, k, and out are outputs. The clk port is used to synchronize the state transitions, while the areset port is used to reset the FSM to its initial state. The j and k ports are used to control the state transitions. The out port is used to indicate the current state of the FSM.   The FSM is implemented using a combinational always block, which is used to determine the next state based on the current state and the values of the j and k ports. If the current state is A, the next state is determined by the value of the j port. If the j port is high, the next state is B, otherwise it is A. Similarly, if the current state is B, the next state is determined by the value of the k port. If the k port is high, the next state is A, otherwise it is B.   The FSM is then implemented using a clocked always block, which is used to update the state of the FSM based on the value of the areset port and the value of the next state.

If the data input is low, the next state will be S.\n\tIf the current state is S11, and the data input is high, the next state will be S110. If the data input is low, then the next state will be S11. If the current state is S110, and the data input is high, the next state will be Done.\n\tIf the data input is low, then the next state will be S.\n\nThis module uses four registers - register Q for storing one bit of data, a 4-bit register with two flip flops - register s0, s1 and register s11 which has five bits in total. The next state depends on the current state as well as input data so the next state is determined using three combinational logic blocks.\nRegister s0 and s1 are reset to zero at any rising edge of clk when the reset pin is low. When the reset pin goes high, register s1 will be initialized with one (which means that it will store a 1-bit data). Register Q will be cleared by having its last bit as zero when the state is S or S1 and will be set to one when the state is S110. This design is verified using ModelSim Xilinx platform."}

The out_both signal is generated by performing a bit-wise AND operation between the two input signals. This will result in a 99-bit wide vector, where each bit is 1 only if both the corresponding bits of the two input signals are 1.  The out_any signal is generated by performing a bit-wise OR operation between the two input signals. This will result in a 100-bit wide vector, where each bit is 1 if either of the corresponding bits of the two input signals is 1.  The out_different signal is generated by performing a bit-wise XOR operation between the two input signals. This will result in a 100-bit wide vector, where each bit is 1 only if the corresponding bits of the two input signals are different. The first bit of the out_different signal is generated by performing a bit-wise XOR operation between the first bit of the first input signal and the last bit of the second input signal.\nKeep your reasoning process short and concise.

Provide the Verilog code design directly.\n\n The top Verilog module is a simple state machine with two states, A and B. It has four inputs: clk, in, reset, and out, and one output, out. The clk input is used to trigger the state machine, the in input is used to determine which state to transition to, the reset input is used to reset the state machine to the initial state, and the out output is used to indicate the current state.  The module is implemented using a parameterized register, state, and a combinational logic block. The parameterized register, state, is used to store the current state of the state machine. The combinational logic block is used to determine the next state of the state machine based on the current state and the in input. If the current state is A, the next state will be A if the in input is high, and B if the in input is low. If the current state is B, the next state will be B if the in input is high, and A if the in input is low.  The module also contains an always block triggered on the rising edge of the clk input. This block is used to update the state register with the next state determined by the combinational logic block. If the reset input is high, the state register is reset to the initial state, B.

The module has four ports: a clock (clk), a reset (reset), an input (w), and an output (z). The module has six states, A to F. The next state of the state machine is determined by the current state and the input w. The transition from state A to state B is taken when the input w is low. The transition from state A to state A is taken when the input w is high. The transition from state B to state D is taken when the input w is high. The transition from state B to state C is taken when the input w is low. The transition from state C to state D is taken when the input w is high. The transition from state C to state E is taken when the input w is low. The transition from state D to state A is taken when the input w is high. The transition from state D to state F is taken when the input w is low. The transition from state E to state D is taken when the input w is high.

The clock input (clk) is used to synchronize the module and is used to trigger the state transitions.  The load input (load) is used to control when the data is loaded into the output register (q). When the load input is high, the data input (data) is loaded into the output register (q).  The enable input (ena) is used to control the direction of the shift. When the enable input is set to 2'h1, the output register (q) is shifted to the left. When the enable input is set to 2'h2, the output register (q) is shifted to the right.

The areset port is an input port that is used to reset the state machine to the initial state. The bump_left and bump_right ports are input ports that indicate whether the robot has bumped into an obstacle on the left or right side. The walk_left and walk_right ports are output ports that indicate the walking direction of the robot.  The module has two parameters, WL and WR, which represent the two states of the state machine. The state machine is implemented using a register, state, and a combinational logic block. The combinational logic block is used to determine the next state of the state machine based on the current state and the bump_left and bump_right inputs. If the current state is WL, the next state will be WR if the bump_left input is high, and WL if the bump_left input is low. Similarly, if the current state is WR, the next state will be WL if the bump_right input is high, and WR if the bump_right input is low.

The inputs to the module are a clock signal (clk), a reset signal (resetn), and a 3-bit vector (r). The outputs of the module are a 3-bit vector (g).   The module has a register, state, that stores the current state of the machine. The register is updated on the rising edge of the clock signal. If the reset signal is low, the state register is set to A. Otherwise, the state register is set to the value of the next register.  The next register stores the next state of the machine. It is updated in the always block. The logic for the next register is a case statement that depends on the current state and the 3-bit vector, r. If the current state is A, then the next state is determined by the value of r. If r[1] is high, then the next state is B. If r[2] is high, then the next state is C. If r[3] is high, then the next state is D. If none of the bits of r are high, then the next state is A.

The module is triggered on the rising edge of the clock signal. When the clock signal is high, the logic circuit evaluates the select signal (L).

The always block assigns the result of the logical AND operation between a and b to out_alwaysblock.

Provide the Verilog code design directly.\n\n The top Verilog module is a finite state machine (FSM) with two states, A and B. It has five ports: clk, j, k, areset, and out. The clk and areset ports are both inputs, while j, k, and out are outputs. The clk port is used to synchronize the state transitions, while the areset port is used to reset the FSM to its initial state. The j and k ports are used to control the state transitions. The out port is used to indicate the current state of the FSM.   The FSM is implemented using a combinational always block, which is used to determine the next state based on the current state and the values of the j and k ports. If the current state is A, the next state is determined by the value of the j port. If the j port is high, the next state is B, otherwise it is A. Similarly, if the current state is B, the next state is determined by the value of the k port. If the k port is high, the next state is A, otherwise it is B.   The FSM is then implemented using a clocked always block, which is used to update the state of the FSM based on the value of the areset port and the value of the next state. If the areset port is high, the state is reset to A. Otherwise, the state is updated to the value of the next state.   Finally, the out port is used to indicate the current state of the FSM.

The 8-bit input signal is used to detect the rising edges. The 8-bit output signal is used to indicate the rising edges.   The module contains a register, d_last, which is used to store the value of the input signal from the previous clock cycle.   The module is always triggered on the rising edge of the clock signal. When triggered, the module stores the current value of the 8-bit input signal in the d_last register. It then calculates the 8-bit output signal, pedge, by performing a bitwise AND operation between the current value of the 8-bit input signal and the inverse of the value stored in the d_last register. This results in a signal that is high only when a rising edge is detected.\nKeep your reasoning process short and concise.

The output is a reversed version of the input. The output is a register, meaning that the output will be stored and can be used in subsequent logic.   The module is composed of an always_comb block. This block is a type of logic block that is used to describe combinational logic. This block is triggered whenever the input signals change.   The always_comb block contains a for loop. This loop iterates over the output bits and assigns each bit to the corresponding bit in the input, but in reverse order. The $bits() function is used to determine the number of bits in the output. This allows the module to be used for inputs and outputs of any size.   The input and output of the module are connected to the input and output ports of the module. The input port is connected to the in signal, and the output port is connected to the out signal. The in signal is a 100-bit input, and the out signal is a 100-bit output.   This module is used to reverse the order of the bits in the input. The output is a reversed version of the input, with the most significant bit of the input becoming the least significant bit of the output, and the least significant bit of the input becoming the most significant bit of the output.\nKeep your reasoning process short and concise.

The areset port is an input port that is used to reset the state machine to the initial state. The bump_left and bump_right ports are input ports that indicate whether the robot has bumped into an obstacle on the left or right side. The walk_left and walk_right ports are output ports that indicate the walking direction of the robot.  The module has two parameters, WL and WR, which represent the two states of the state machine. The state machine is implemented using a register, state, and a combinational logic block. The combinational logic block is used to determine the next state of the state machine based on the current state and the bump_left and bump_right inputs. If the current state is WL, the next state will be WR if the bump_left input is high, and WL if the bump_left input is low. Similarly, if the current state is WR, the next state will be WL if the bump_right input is high, and WR if the bump_right input is low.

The module is triggered on the rising edge of the clock signal. When the clock signal is high, the logic circuit evaluates the select signal (L).

Depending on the value of the input, the output port \"pos\" will be set to a different 3-bit value.  The default case is used to set the output port \"pos\" to the default value of 0. The other cases are used to set the output port \"pos\" to a different 3-bit value depending on the value of the 8-bit input \"in\". For example, if the 8-bit input \"in\" is equal to 8'bzzzzzzz1, then the output port \"pos\" will be set to 3'h0. Similarly, if the 8-bit input \"in\" is equal to 8'bz1zzzzzz, then the output port \"pos\" will be set to 3'h6.  Once the output port \"pos\" has been set, its value will remain until the 8-bit input \"in\" changes. This module can be used to determine the position of a given 8-bit input in a range of values.\nKeep your reasoning process short and concise.

The clk port is used to synchronize the state transitions, while the areset port is used to reset the FSM to its initial state. The j and k ports are used to control the state transitions.

The inputs a and b are the two numbers to be added, while cin is the carry-in bit. The output cout is the carry-out bit, and sum is the result of the addition of a and b plus the carry-in bit.   The module uses an assign statement to calculate the outputs. The assign statement adds the inputs a and b, plus the carry-in bit, and assigns the result to the outputs cout and sum. The carry-out bit is calculated by determining if the sum of the inputs is greater than or equal to 2. If it is, then the carry-out bit is set to 1, otherwise it is set to 0. The sum output is the result of the addition of a, b, and cin, modulo 2.\nKeep your reasoning process short and concise.

Provide the Verilog code design directly.\n\n This top Verilog module implements a 32-bit shift register. The module has 3 ports: clk, reset, and q. The clk port is an input port that is used to synchronize the register. The reset port is an input port that is used to reset the register to the initial value. The q port is an output port that is used to output the value of the register. The module has two registers, q and q_next. The q_next register stores the next value of the register. The q register is updated on the rising edge of the clk signal. If the reset port is high, the register is reset to the initial value, 32'h1. Otherwise, the q register is updated with the value stored in the q_next register. The q_next register is updated on every clock cycle, and stores the value of the q register shifted by 1 bit. If the value of the q register is shifted out of bit 0, it is sent back to bit 31. Bits 21 and 1 are XORed with the value of bit 0. Bit 0 is also XORed with the value of bit 0.\n\n\n\nKeep your reasoning process short and concise.

The output is a reversed version of the input. The output is a register, meaning that the output will be stored and can be used in subsequent logic.   The module is composed of an always_comb block. This block is a type of logic block that is used to describe combinational logic. This block is triggered whenever the input signals change.   The always_comb block contains a for loop. This loop iterates over the output bits and assigns each bit to the corresponding bit in the input, but in reverse order. The $bits() function is used to determine the number of bits in the output. This allows the module to be used for inputs and outputs of any size.   The input and output of the module are connected to the input and output ports of the module. The input port is connected to the in signal, and the output port is connected to the out signal. The in signal is a 100-bit input, and the out signal is a 100-bit output.   This module is used to reverse the order of the bits in the input. The output is a reversed version of the input, with the most significant bit of the input becoming the least significant bit of the output, and the least significant bit of the input becoming the most significant bit of the output.\nKeep your reasoning process short and concise.

The module has four inputs: clk, slowena, reset, and four outputs: q. The clk input is a clock signal used to synchronize the counter. The slowena input is an enable signal that must be asserted for the counter to increment. The reset input is an asynchronous reset signal that resets the counter to 0 when asserted. The q output is a 4-bit register that stores the current value of the counter.   The module contains an always block that is triggered on the rising edge of the clock signal.

The clk port is an input signal that is used to control the timing of the module. The in port is an 8-bit input signal that is used as the signal to detect edges on. The anyedge port is an 8-bit output signal that is used to indicate if an edge was detected on the in signal.  The module contains a register d_last that is used to store the previous value of the in signal. The always block is used to detect any edge on the in signal. Inside the always block, the d_last register is updated with the current value of the in signal. The anyedge output signal is then calculated by performing an exclusive-or (XOR) operation between the current value of the in signal and the value stored in the d_last register. If the values are different, then an edge was detected and the anyedge output signal will be set to 1.

Provide the Verilog code design directly.\n\n The top Verilog module is a simple state machine with two states, A and B. It has four inputs: clk, in, reset, and out, and one output, out. The clk input is used to trigger the state machine, the in input is used to determine which state to transition to, the reset input is used to reset the state machine to the initial state, and the out output is used to indicate the current state.  The module is implemented using a parameterized register, state, and a combinational logic block. The parameterized register, state, is used to store the current state of the state machine. The combinational logic block is used to determine the next state of the state machine based on the current state and the in input. If the current state is A, the next state will be A if the in input is high, and B if the in input is low. If the current state is B, the next state will be B if the in input is high, and A if the in input is low.  The module also contains an always block triggered on the rising edge of the clk input. This block is used to update the state register with the next state determined by the combinational logic block. If the reset input is high, the state register is reset to the initial state, B. Otherwise, the state register is updated with the next state determined by the combinational logic block.  Finally, the out output is assigned the value of the state register.

Provide the Verilog code design directly.\n\n This top Verilog module is a state machine that controls the walking direction of a robot. The module has 6 ports: clk, areset, bump_left, bump_right, walk_left, and walk_right. The clk port is an input port that is used to synchronize the state machine. The areset port is an input port that is used to reset the state machine to the initial state. The bump_left and bump_right ports are input ports that indicate whether the robot has bumped into an obstacle on the left or right side. The walk_left and walk_right ports are output ports that indicate the walking direction of the robot.  The module has two parameters, WL and WR, which represent the two states of the state machine. The state machine is implemented using a register, state, and a combinational logic block. The combinational logic block is used to determine the next state of the state machine based on the current state and the bump_left and bump_right inputs. If the current state is WL, the next state will be WR if the bump_left input is high, and WL if the bump_left input is low. Similarly, if the current state is WR, the next state will be WL if the bump_right input is high, and WR if the bump_right input is low.  The state machine is updated on the rising edge of the clk signal, and is reset to the initial state (WL) on the rising edge of the areset signal. The walk_left and walk_right outputs are assigned based on the current state of the state machine. If the state is WL, the walk_left output will be high and the walk_right output will be low.

The module contains an always block, which is triggered whenever any of the inputs change. Inside the always block is a casez statement, which is used to compare the value of the 8-bit input \"in\" to a set of predefined values. Depending on the value of the input, the output port \"pos\" will be set to a different 3-bit value.  The default case is used to set the output port \"pos\" to the default value of 0. The other cases are used to set the output port \"pos\" to a different 3-bit value depending on the value of the 8-bit input \"in\". For example, if the 8-bit input \"in\" is equal to 8'bzzzzzzz1, then the output port \"pos\" will be set to 3'h0.

The fan_on input is used to control the fan. If fan_on is high, the fan will be turned on regardless of the mode.  The too_cold and too_hot inputs are used to determine the temperature of the room. If too_cold is high, the room is too cold and if too_hot is high, the room is too hot.  The fan output is used to control the fan. If fan is high, the fan will be turned on. The fan will be turned on if either too_cold or too_hot is high, or if fan_on is high.  The heater output is used to control the heater. If heater is high, the heater will be turned on. The heater will be turned on if mode is high and too_cold is high.  The aircon output is used to control the air conditioner. If aircon is high, the air conditioner will be turned on. The air conditioner will be turned on if mode is low and too_hot is high.\nKeep your reasoning process short and concise.

The transition from state A to state A is taken when the input w is high. The transition from state B to state D is taken when the input w is high. The transition from state B to state C is taken when the input w is low. The transition from state C to state D is taken when the input w is high. The transition from state C to state E is taken when the input w is low. The transition from state D to state A is taken when the input w is high. The transition from state D to state F is taken when the input w is low. The transition from state E to state D is taken when the input w is high. The transition from state E to state E is taken when the input w is low. The transition from state F to state D is taken when the input w is high. The transition from state F to state C is taken when the input w is low.  The state machine is triggered by the clk signal. When the clk signal is high, the state machine will check the reset signal. If the reset signal is high, the state machine will reset to state A, otherwise the state machine will transition to the next state. The output z is high when the state machine is in state E or F, and is low otherwise.\n\n\n\nKeep your reasoning process short and concise.

This loop iterates over the output bits and assigns each bit to the corresponding bit in the input, but in reverse order. The $bits() function is used to determine the number of bits in the output. This allows the module to be used for inputs and outputs of any size.   The input and output of the module are connected to the input and output ports of the module. The input port is connected to the in signal, and the output port is connected to the out signal. The in signal is a 100-bit input, and the out signal is a 100-bit output.   This module is used to reverse the order of the bits in the input. The output is a reversed version of the input, with the most significant bit of the input becoming the least significant bit of the output, and the least significant bit of the input becoming the most significant bit of the output.\nKeep your reasoning process short and concise.

The module has four inputs: clk, slowena, reset, and four outputs: q. The clk input is a clock signal used to synchronize the counter. The slowena input is an enable signal that must be asserted for the counter to increment. The reset input is an asynchronous reset signal that resets the counter to 0 when asserted. The q output is a 4-bit register that stores the current value of the counter.   The module contains an always block that is triggered on the rising edge of the clock signal. Inside the always block, the module first checks the reset signal. If the reset signal is asserted, the counter is reset to 0. If the reset signal is not asserted, the module checks the slowena signal. If the slowena signal is asserted, the module checks the value of the counter.

Provide the Verilog code design directly.\n\n The top Verilog module is a simple state machine with two states, A and B. It has four inputs: clk, in, reset, and out, and one output, out. The clk input is used to trigger the state machine, the in input is used to determine which state to transition to, the reset input is used to reset the state machine to the initial state, and the out output is used to indicate the current state.  The module is implemented using a parameterized register, state, and a combinational logic block. The parameterized register, state, is used to store the current state of the state machine. The combinational logic block is used to determine the next state of the state machine based on the current state and the in input. If the current state is A, the next state will be A if the in input is high, and B if the in input is low. If the current state is B, the next state will be B if the in input is high, and A if the in input is low.  The module also contains an always block triggered on the rising edge of the clk input. This block is used to update the state register with the next state determined by the combinational logic block. If the reset input is high, the state register is reset to the initial state, B. Otherwise, the state register is updated with the next state determined by the combinational logic block.  Finally, the out output is assigned the value of the state register.

Provide the Verilog code design directly.\n\n This top Verilog module is a state machine that outputs a one-bit signal z. The module has four ports: a clock (clk), a reset (reset), an input (w), and an output (z). The module has six states, A to F. The next state of the state machine is determined by the current state and the input w. The transition from state A to state B is taken when the input w is low. The transition from state A to state A is taken when the input w is high. The transition from state B to state D is taken when the input w is high. The transition from state B to state C is taken when the input w is low. The transition from state C to state D is taken when the input w is high. The transition from state C to state E is taken when the input w is low. The transition from state D to state A is taken when the input w is high. The transition from state D to state F is taken when the input w is low. The transition from state E to state D is taken when the input w is high. The transition from state E to state E is taken when the input w is low. The transition from state F to state D is taken when the input w is high. The transition from state F to state C is taken when the input w is low.  The state machine is triggered by the clk signal. When the clk signal is high, the state machine will check the reset signal.
