Provide the Verilog code design directly.\n\nWe want a finite state machine that will search for message boundaries when given an input byte stream. The algorithm we'll use is to discard bytes until we see one with in[3]=1. We then assume that this is byte 1 of a message, and signal the receipt of a message once all 3 bytes have been received (done). The FSM should signal done in the cycle immediately after the third byte of each message was successfully received.\n\n// Implement the datapath module that will output the 24-bit (3 byte) message whenever a packet is received (out_bytes[23:16] is the first byte, out_bytes[15:8] is the second byte, etc.). The reset signal is active high synchronous. out_bytes needs to be valid whenever the done signal is asserted.

In the Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left (walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch directions if it hits an obstacle.

This FSM acts as an arbiter circuit, which controls access to some type of resource by three requesting devices. Each device makes its request for the resource by setting a signal _r[i]_ = 1, where _r[i]_ is either _r[1]_, _r[2]_, or _r[3]_. Each r[i] is an input signal to the FSM, and represents one of the three devices. The FSM stays in state _A_ as long as there are no requests. When one or more request occurs, then the FSM decides which device receives a grant to use the resource and changes to a state that sets that device's _g[i]_ signal to 1. Each _g[i]_ is an output from the FSM. There is a priority system, in that device 1 has a higher priority than device 2, and device 3 has the lowest priority. Hence, for example, device 3 will only receive a grant if it is the only device making a request when the FSM is in state _A_. Once a device, _i_, is given a grant by the FSM, that device continues to receive the grant as long as its request, _r[i]_ = 1.\n\n// Write complete Verilog code that represents this FSM.

The FSM has inputs x and y, which come from the motor, and produces outputs f and g, which control the motor. There is also a clock input called clk and a reset input (synchronous, active low) called resetn. The FSM has to work as follows. As long as the reset input is asserted, the FSM stays in a beginning state, called state A. When the reset signal is de-asserted, then after the next clock edge the FSM has to set the output f to 1 for one clock cycle. Then, the FSM has to monitor the x input. When x has produced the values 1, 0, 1 in three successive clock cycles, then g should be set to 1 on the following clock cycle. While maintaining g = 1 the FSM has to monitor the y input. If y has the value 1 within at most two clock cycles, then the FSM should maintain g = 1 permanently (that is, until reset).

Seeing exactly 6 consecutive 1s (i.e., 01111110) is a \"flag\" that indicate frame boundaries. To avoid the data stream from accidentally containing \"flags\", the sender inserts a zero after every 5 consecutive 1s which the receiver must detect and discard. We also need to signal an error if there are 7 or more consecutive 1s.

In order to keep the level of water succificently high, three sensors are placed vertically at 5-inch intervals. When the water level is above the highest sensor s[3], the input flow rate should be zero. When the level is below the lowest sensor s[1], the flow rate should be at maximum (both Nominal flow valve and Supplemental flow valve opened).

Provide the Verilog code design directly.\n\nBuild a gshare branch predictor with 7-bit pc and 7-bit global history, hashed (using xor) into a 7-bit index. This index accesses a 128-entry table of two-bit saturating counters. The branch predictor should contain a 7-bit global branch history register. The branch predictor has two sets of interfaces: One for doing predictions and one for doing training. The prediction interface is used in the processor's Fetch stage to ask the branch predictor for branch direction predictions for the instructions being fetched. Once these branches proceed down the pipeline and are executed, the true outcomes of the branches become known. The branch predictor is then trained using the actual branch direction outcomes. \n// When a branch prediction is requested (predict_valid = 1) for a given pc, the branch predictor produces the predicted branch direction and state of the branch history register used to make the prediction. The branch history register is then updated (at the next positive clock edge) for the predicted branch. \n// When training for a branch is requested (train_valid = 1), the branch predictor is told the pc and branch history register value for the branch that is being trained, as well as the actual branch outcome and whether the branch was a misprediction (needing a pipeline flush). Update the pattern history table (PHT) to train the branch predictor to predict this branch more accurately next time. In addition, if the branch being trained is mispredicted, also recover the branch history register to the state immediately after the mispredicting branch completes execution.\n// If training for a misprediction and a prediction (for a different, younger instruction) occurs in the same cycle, both operations will want to modify the branch history register. When this happens, training takes precedence, because the branch being predicted will be discarded anyway. If training and prediction of the same PHT entry happen at the same time, the prediction sees the PHT state before training because training only modifies the PHT at the next positive clock edge. The following timing diagram shows the timing when training and predicting PHT entry 0 at the same time. The training request at cycle 4 changes the PHT entry state in cycle 5, but the prediction request in cycle 4 outputs the PHT state at cycle 4, without considering the effect of the training request in cycle 4.

Provide the Verilog code design directly.\n\nThe game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left (walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it's bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left. If it's bumped on both sides at the same time, it will still switch directions. \n// In addition to walking left and right and changing direction when bumped, when ground=0, the Lemming will fall and say \"\"aaah!\"\". When the ground reappears (ground=1), the Lemming will resume walking in the same direction as before the fall. Being bumped while falling does not affect the walking direction, and being bumped in the same cycle as ground disappears (but not yet falling), or when the ground reappears while still falling, also does not affect the walking direction.\n// In addition to walking and falling, Lemmings can sometimes be told to do useful things, like dig (it starts digging when dig=1). A Lemming can dig if it is currently walking on ground (ground=1 and not falling), and will continue digging until it reaches the other side (ground=0). At that point, since there is no ground, it will fall (aaah!), then continue walking in its original direction once it hits ground again. As with falling, being bumped while digging has no effect, and being told to dig when falling or when there is no ground is ignored. (In other words, a walking Lemming can fall, dig, or switch directions. If more than one of these conditions are satisfied, fall has higher precedence than dig, which has higher precedence than switching directions.)\n// Although Lemmings can walk, fall, and dig, Lemmings aren't invulnerable. If a Lemming falls for too long then hits the ground, it can splatter. In particular, if a Lemming falls for more than 20 clock cycles then hits the ground, it will splatter and cease walking, falling, or digging (all 4 outputs become 0), forever (Or until the FSM gets reset). There is no upper limit on how far a Lemming can fall before hitting the ground.

The algorithm we'll use is to discard bytes until we see one with in[3]=1. We then assume that this is byte 1 of a message, and signal the receipt of a message once all 3 bytes have been received (done). The FSM should signal done in the cycle immediately after the third byte of each message was successfully received.\n\n// Implement the datapath module that will output the 24-bit (3 byte) message whenever a packet is received (out_bytes[23:16] is the first byte, out_bytes[15:8] is the second byte, etc.). The reset signal is active high synchronous. out_bytes needs to be valid whenever the done signal is asserted. You may output anything at other times (i.e., don't-care). \n\n// Waveform example:\n// time            clk             reset           in[7:0]         done            out_bytes       \n// 0ns             0               1                0              x                    x          \n// 5ns             1               1                0              0                    x          \n// 10ns            0               1                0              0                    x          \n// 15ns            1               0               2c              0                    x          \n// 20ns            0               0               2c              0                    x          \n// 25ns            1               0               81              0                    x          \n// 30ns            0               0               81              0                    x          \n// 35ns            1               0                9              0                    x          \n// 40ns            0               0                9              0                    x          \n// 45ns            1               0               6b              1               2c8109          \n// 50ns            0               0               6b              1               2c8109          \n// 55ns            1               0                d              0                    x          \n// 60ns            0               0                d              0                    x          \n// 65ns            1               0               8d              0                    x          \n// 70ns            0               0               8d              0                    x          \n// 75ns            1               0               6d              1               6b0d8d          \n// 80ns            0               0               6d              1               6b0d8d          \n// 85ns            1               0               12              0                    x          \n// 90ns            0               0               12              0                    x          \n// 95ns            1               0                1              0                    x          \n// 100ns           0               0                1              0                    x          \n// 105ns           1               0                d              1               6d1201          \n// 110ns           0               0                d              1               6d1201          \n// 115ns           1               0               76              0                    x          \n// 120ns           0               0               76              0                    x          \n// 125ns           1               0               3d              0                    x          \n// 130ns           0               0               3d              0                    x          \n// 135ns           1               0               ed              1                d763d          \n// 140ns           0               0               ed              1                d763d          \n// 145ns           1               0               8c              0                    x          \n// 150ns           0               0               8c              0                    x          \n// 155ns           1               0               f9              0                    x          \n// 160ns           0               0               f9              0                    x          \n// 165ns           1               0               ce              1               ed8cf9          \n// 170ns           0               0               ce              1               ed8cf9          \n// 175ns           1               0               c5              0                    x          \n// 180ns           0               0               c5              0                    x          \n// 185ns           1               0               aa              0                    x          \n// 190ns           0               0               aa              0                    x          \nPlease complete the Verilog code below and return the complete module code.

This is the history before the mispredicted branch (train_history) concatenated with the actual result of the branch (train_taken). If both a prediction and misprediction occur at the same time, the misprediction takes precedence, because the pipeline flush will also flush out the branch that is currently making a prediction. predict_history is the value of the branch history register. areset is a positive edge triggered asynchronous reset that resets the history counter to zero.\n\n\nPlease complete the Verilog code below and return the complete module code.

This FSM acts as an arbiter circuit, which controls access to some type of resource by three requesting devices. Each device makes its request for the resource by setting a signal _r[i]_ = 1, where _r[i]_ is either _r[1]_, _r[2]_, or _r[3]_. Each r[i] is an input signal to the FSM, and represents one of the three devices. The FSM stays in state _A_ as long as there are no requests. When one or more request occurs, then the FSM decides which device receives a grant to use the resource and changes to a state that sets that device's _g[i]_ signal to 1. Each _g[i]_ is an output from the FSM. There is a priority system, in that device 1 has a higher priority than device 2, and device 3 has the lowest priority. Hence, for example, device 3 will only receive a grant if it is the only device making a request when the FSM is in state _A_. Once a device, _i_, is given a grant by the FSM, that device continues to receive the grant as long as its request, _r[i]_ = 1.\n\n// Write complete Verilog code that represents this FSM.

The only indication is that the first byte of each three byte message always has in[3]=1 (but in[3] of the other two bytes may be 1 or 0 depending on data). We want a finite state machine that will search for message boundaries when given an input byte stream. The algorithm we'll use is to discard bytes until we see one with in[3]=1. We then assume that this is byte 1 of a message, and signal the receipt of a message once all 3 bytes have been received (done). The FSM should signal done in the cycle immediately after the third byte of each message was successfully received.

Provide the Verilog code design directly.\n\nConsider a finite state machine that is used to control some type of motor. The FSM has inputs x and y, which come from the motor, and produces outputs f and g, which control the motor. There is also a clock input called clk and a reset input (synchronous, active low) called resetn. The FSM has to work as follows. As long as the reset input is asserted, the FSM stays in a beginning state, called state A. When the reset signal is de-asserted, then after the next clock edge the FSM has to set the output f to 1 for one clock cycle. Then, the FSM has to monitor the x input. When x has produced the values 1, 0, 1 in three successive clock cycles, then g should be set to 1 on the following clock cycle. While maintaining g = 1 the FSM has to monitor the y input. If y has the value 1 within at most two clock cycles, then the FSM should maintain g = 1 permanently (that is, until reset). But if y does not become 1 within two clock cycles, then the FSM should set g = 0 permanently (until reset).\nPlease complete the Verilog code below and return the complete module code.

This is done by replicating the sign bit (the most significant bit) of the smaller number to the left. For example, sign-extending 4'b0101 (5) to 8 bits results in 8'b00000101 (5), while sign-extending 4'b1101 (-3) to 8 bits results in 8'b11111101 (-3).

When the water level is above the highest sensor s[3], the input flow rate should be zero. When the level is below the lowest sensor s[1], the flow rate should be at maximum (both Nominal flow valve and Supplemental flow valve opened). The flow rate when the level is between the upper and lower sensors is determined by two factors: the water level and the level previous to the last sensor change. Each water level has a nominal flow rate associated with it as show in the table below. If the sensor change indicates that the previous level was lower than the current level, the flow rate should be increased by opening the Supplemental flow valve (controlled by dfr). \n// Water Level | Sensors Asserted | Nominal Flow Rate Inputs to be Asserted\n// Above s[3] | s[1], s[2], s[3] | None\n// Between s[3] and s[2] | s[1], s[2] | fr1\n// Between s[2] and s[1]  | s[1] | fr1, fr2\n// Below s[1] | None | fr1, fr2, fr3\n// Also include an active-high synchronous reset that resets the state machine to a state equivalent to if the water level had been low for a long time (no sensors asserted, and all four outputs asserted).\nPlease complete the Verilog code below and return the complete module code.

Provide the Verilog code design directly.\n\nBuild a gshare branch predictor with 7-bit pc and 7-bit global history, hashed (using xor) into a 7-bit index. This index accesses a 128-entry table of two-bit saturating counters. The branch predictor should contain a 7-bit global branch history register. The branch predictor has two sets of interfaces: One for doing predictions and one for doing training. The prediction interface is used in the processor's Fetch stage to ask the branch predictor for branch direction predictions for the instructions being fetched. Once these branches proceed down the pipeline and are executed, the true outcomes of the branches become known. The branch predictor is then trained using the actual branch direction outcomes. \n// When a branch prediction is requested (predict_valid = 1) for a given pc, the branch predictor produces the predicted branch direction and state of the branch history register used to make the prediction. The branch history register is then updated (at the next positive clock edge) for the predicted branch. \n// When training for a branch is requested (train_valid = 1), the branch predictor is told the pc and branch history register value for the branch that is being trained, as well as the actual branch outcome and whether the branch was a misprediction (needing a pipeline flush). Update the pattern history table (PHT) to train the branch predictor to predict this branch more accurately next time. In addition, if the branch being trained is mispredicted, also recover the branch history register to the state immediately after the mispredicting branch completes execution.\n// If training for a misprediction and a prediction (for a different, younger instruction) occurs in the same cycle, both operations will want to modify the branch history register. When this happens, training takes precedence, because the branch being predicted will be discarded anyway. If training and prediction of the same PHT entry happen at the same time, the prediction sees the PHT state before training because training only modifies the PHT at the next positive clock edge. The following timing diagram shows the timing when training and predicting PHT entry 0 at the same time. The training request at cycle 4 changes the PHT entry state in cycle 5, but the prediction request in cycle 4 outputs the PHT state at cycle 4, without considering the effect of the training request in cycle 4.

Provide the Verilog code design directly.\n\nThe game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left (walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it's bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left. If it's bumped on both sides at the same time, it will still switch directions. \n// In addition to walking left and right and changing direction when bumped, when ground=0, the Lemming will fall and say \"\"aaah!\"\". When the ground reappears (ground=1), the Lemming will resume walking in the same direction as before the fall. Being bumped while falling does not affect the walking direction, and being bumped in the same cycle as ground disappears (but not yet falling), or when the ground reappears while still falling, also does not affect the walking direction.\n// In addition to walking and falling, Lemmings can sometimes be told to do useful things, like dig (it starts digging when dig=1). A Lemming can dig if it is currently walking on ground (ground=1 and not falling), and will continue digging until it reaches the other side (ground=0). At that point, since there is no ground, it will fall (aaah!), then continue walking in its original direction once it hits ground again. As with falling, being bumped while digging has no effect, and being told to dig when falling or when there is no ground is ignored. (In other words, a walking Lemming can fall, dig, or switch directions. If more than one of these conditions are satisfied, fall has higher precedence than dig, which has higher precedence than switching directions.)\n// Although Lemmings can walk, fall, and dig, Lemmings aren't invulnerable. If a Lemming falls for too long then hits the ground, it can splatter. In particular, if a Lemming falls for more than 20 clock cycles then hits the ground, it will splatter and cease walking, falling, or digging (all 4 outputs become 0), forever (Or until the FSM gets reset). There is no upper limit on how far a Lemming can fall before hitting the ground.

In the Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left (walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it's bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left.

A Lemming can dig if it is currently walking on ground (ground=1 and not falling), and will continue digging until it reaches the other side (ground=0). At that point, since there is no ground, it will fall (aaah!), then continue walking in its original direction once it hits ground again. As with falling, being bumped while digging has no effect, and being told to dig when falling or when there is no ground is ignored. (In other words, a walking Lemming can fall, dig, or switch directions.

You may output anything at other times (i.e., don't-care). \n\n// Waveform example:\n// time            clk             reset           in[7:0]         done            out_bytes       \n// 0ns             0               1                0              x                    x          \n// 5ns             1               1                0              0                    x          \n// 10ns            0               1                0              0                    x          \n// 15ns            1               0               2c              0                    x          \n// 20ns            0               0               2c              0                    x          \n// 25ns            1               0               81              0                    x          \n// 30ns            0               0               81              0                    x          \n// 35ns            1               0                9              0                    x          \n// 40ns            0               0                9              0                    x          \n// 45ns            1               0               6b              1               2c8109          \n// 50ns            0               0               6b              1               2c8109          \n// 55ns            1               0                d              0                    x          \n// 60ns            0               0                d              0                    x          \n// 65ns            1               0               8d              0                    x          \n// 70ns            0               0               8d              0                    x          \n// 75ns            1               0               6d              1               6b0d8d          \n// 80ns            0               0               6d              1               6b0d8d          \n// 85ns            1               0               12              0                    x          \n// 90ns            0               0               12              0                    x          \n// 95ns            1               0                1              0                    x          \n// 100ns           0               0                1              0                    x          \n// 105ns           1               0                d              1               6d1201          \n// 110ns           0               0                d              1               6d1201          \n// 115ns           1               0               76              0                    x          \n// 120ns           0               0               76              0                    x          \n// 125ns           1               0               3d              0                    x          \n// 130ns           0               0               3d              0                    x          \n// 135ns           1               0               ed              1                d763d          \n// 140ns           0               0               ed              1                d763d          \n// 145ns           1               0               8c              0                    x          \n// 150ns           0               0               8c              0                    x          \n// 155ns           1               0               f9              0                    x          \n// 160ns           0               0               f9              0                    x          \n// 165ns           1               0               ce              1               ed8cf9          \n// 170ns           0               0               ce              1               ed8cf9          \n// 175ns           1               0               c5              0                    x          \n// 180ns           0               0               c5              0                    x          \n// 185ns           1               0               aa              0                    x          \n// 190ns           0               0               aa              0                    x          \nPlease complete the Verilog code below and return the complete module code.

This FSM acts as an arbiter circuit, which controls access to some type of resource by three requesting devices. Each device makes its request for the resource by setting a signal _r[i]_ = 1, where _r[i]_ is either _r[1]_, _r[2]_, or _r[3]_. Each r[i] is an input signal to the FSM, and represents one of the three devices. The FSM stays in state _A_ as long as there are no requests. When one or more request occurs, then the FSM decides which device receives a grant to use the resource and changes to a state that sets that device's _g[i]_ signal to 1. Each _g[i]_ is an output from the FSM. There is a priority system, in that device 1 has a higher priority than device 2, and device 3 has the lowest priority. Hence, for example, device 3 will only receive a grant if it is the only device making a request when the FSM is in state _A_. Once a device, _i_, is given a grant by the FSM, that device continues to receive the grant as long as its request, _r[i]_ = 1.\n\n// Write complete Verilog code that represents this FSM.

The FSM has inputs x and y, which come from the motor, and produces outputs f and g, which control the motor. There is also a clock input called clk and a reset input (synchronous, active low) called resetn. The FSM has to work as follows. As long as the reset input is asserted, the FSM stays in a beginning state, called state A. When the reset signal is de-asserted, then after the next clock edge the FSM has to set the output f to 1 for one clock cycle. Then, the FSM has to monitor the x input. When x has produced the values 1, 0, 1 in three successive clock cycles, then g should be set to 1 on the following clock cycle. While maintaining g = 1 the FSM has to monitor the y input. If y has the value 1 within at most two clock cycles, then the FSM should maintain g = 1 permanently (that is, until reset). But if y does not become 1 within two clock cycles, then the FSM should set g = 0 permanently (until reset).\nPlease complete the Verilog code below and return the complete module code.

Seeing exactly 6 consecutive 1s (i.e., 01111110) is a \"flag\" that indicate frame boundaries. To avoid the data stream from accidentally containing \"flags\", the sender inserts a zero after every 5 consecutive 1s which the receiver must detect and discard. We also need to signal an error if there are 7 or more consecutive 1s. Create a Moore-type finite state machine to recognize these three sequences:\n\n// (1) 0111110: Signal a bit needs to be discarded (disc).\n// (2) 01111110: Flag the beginning/end of a frame (flag).\n// (3) 01111111...: Error (7 or more 1s) (err).\n\n// When the FSM is reset, it should be in a state that behaves as though the previous input were 0.

In order to keep the level of water succificently high, three sensors are placed vertically at 5-inch intervals. When the water level is above the highest sensor s[3], the input flow rate should be zero. When the level is below the lowest sensor s[1], the flow rate should be at maximum (both Nominal flow valve and Supplemental flow valve opened). The flow rate when the level is between the upper and lower sensors is determined by two factors: the water level and the level previous to the last sensor change. Each water level has a nominal flow rate associated with it as show in the table below. If the sensor change indicates that the previous level was lower than the current level, the flow rate should be increased by opening the Supplemental flow valve (controlled by dfr). \n// Water Level | Sensors Asserted | Nominal Flow Rate Inputs to be Asserted\n// Above s[3] | s[1], s[2], s[3] | None\n// Between s[3] and s[2] | s[1], s[2] | fr1\n// Between s[2] and s[1]  | s[1] | fr1, fr2\n// Below s[1] | None | fr1, fr2, fr3\n// Also include an active-high synchronous reset that resets the state machine to a state equivalent to if the water level had been low for a long time (no sensors asserted, and all four outputs asserted).\nPlease complete the Verilog code below and return the complete module code.

{"task_id": "gshare", "description": "You are a Verilog expert. Be concise and focused on the key points and avoid repetitive thoughts. Provide the Verilog code design directly.\n\nBuild a gshare branch predictor with 7-bit pc and 7-bit global history, hashed (using xor) into a 7-bit index. This index accesses a 128-entry table of two-bit saturating counters. The branch predictor should contain a 7-bit global branch history register. The branch predictor has two sets of interfaces: One for doing predictions and one for doing training. The prediction interface is used in the processor's Fetch stage to ask the branch predictor for branch direction predictions for the instructions being fetched. Once these branches proceed down the pipeline and are executed, the true outcomes of the branches become known. The branch predictor is then trained using the actual branch direction outcomes. \n// When a branch prediction is requested (predict_valid = 1) for a given pc, the branch predictor produces the predicted branch direction and state of the branch history register used to make the prediction. The branch history register is then updated (at the next positive clock edge) for the predicted branch. \n// When training for a branch is requested (train_valid = 1), the branch predictor is told the pc and branch history register value for the branch that is being trained, as well as the actual branch outcome and whether the branch was a misprediction (needing a pipeline flush). Update the pattern history table (PHT) to train the branch predictor to predict this branch more accurately next time. In addition, if the branch being trained is mispredicted, also recover the branch history register to the state immediately after the mispredicting branch completes execution.\n// If training for a misprediction and a prediction (for a different, younger instruction) occurs in the same cycle, both operations will want to modify the branch history register. When this happens, training takes precedence, because the branch being predicted will be discarded anyway. If training and prediction of the same PHT entry happen at the same time, the prediction sees the PHT state before training because training only modifies the PHT at the next positive clock edge. The following timing diagram shows the timing when training and predicting PHT entry 0 at the same time. The training request at cycle 4 changes the PHT entry state in cycle 5, but the prediction request in cycle 4 outputs the PHT state at cycle 4, without considering the effect of the training request in cycle 4.

Provide the Verilog code design directly.\n\nThe game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left (walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it's bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left. If it's bumped on both sides at the same time, it will still switch directions. \n// In addition to walking left and right and changing direction when bumped, when ground=0, the Lemming will fall and say \"\"aaah!\"\". When the ground reappears (ground=1), the Lemming will resume walking in the same direction as before the fall. Being bumped while falling does not affect the walking direction, and being bumped in the same cycle as ground disappears (but not yet falling), or when the ground reappears while still falling, also does not affect the walking direction.\n// In addition to walking and falling, Lemmings can sometimes be told to do useful things, like dig (it starts digging when dig=1). A Lemming can dig if it is currently walking on ground (ground=1 and not falling), and will continue digging until it reaches the other side (ground=0). At that point, since there is no ground, it will fall (aaah!), then continue walking in its original direction once it hits ground again. As with falling, being bumped while digging has no effect, and being told to dig when falling or when there is no ground is ignored. (In other words, a walking Lemming can fall, dig, or switch directions. If more than one of these conditions are satisfied, fall has higher precedence than dig, which has higher precedence than switching directions.)\n// Although Lemmings can walk, fall, and dig, Lemmings aren't invulnerable. If a Lemming falls for too long then hits the ground, it can splatter. In particular, if a Lemming falls for more than 20 clock cycles then hits the ground, it will splatter and cease walking, falling, or digging (all 4 outputs become 0), forever (Or until the FSM gets reset). There is no upper limit on how far a Lemming can fall before hitting the ground.

The state machine should have a active high synchronous reset, setting the state to where it begins searching for the input sequence 1101.\nPlease complete the Verilog code below and return the complete module code.

In the Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left (walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it's bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left.

When a branch prediction is made (predict_valid = 1), shift in predict_taken from the LSB side to update the branch history for the predicted branch.

This is the history before the mispredicted branch (train_history) concatenated with the actual result of the branch (train_taken).

We want to know some relationships between each bit and its neighbour: \n// (1) out_both: Each bit of this output vector should indicate whether both the corresponding input bit and its neighbour to the left (higher index) are '1'. For example, out_both[2] should indicate if in[2] and in[3] are both 1. Since in[3] has no neighbour to the left, the answer is obvious so we don't need to know out_both[3]. \n// (2) out_any: Each bit of this output vector should indicate whether any of the corresponding input bit and its neighbour to the right are '1'. For example, out_any[2] should indicate if either in[2] or in[1] are 1. Since in[0] has no neighbour to the right, the answer is obvious so we don't need to know out_any[0]. \n// (3) out_different: Each bit of this output vector should indicate whether the corresponding input bit is different from its neighbour to the left.

This FSM acts as an arbiter circuit, which controls access to some type of resource by three requesting devices. Each device makes its request for the resource by setting a signal _r[i]_ = 1, where _r[i]_ is either _r[1]_, _r[2]_, or _r[3]_. Each r[i] is an input signal to the FSM, and represents one of the three devices. The FSM stays in state _A_ as long as there are no requests. When one or more request occurs, then the FSM decides which device receives a grant to use the resource and changes to a state that sets that device's _g[i]_ signal to 1. Each _g[i]_ is an output from the FSM. There is a priority system, in that device 1 has a higher priority than device 2, and device 3 has the lowest priority. Hence, for example, device 3 will only receive a grant if it is the only device making a request when the FSM is in state _A_. Once a device, _i_, is given a grant by the FSM, that device continues to receive the grant as long as its request, _r[i]_ = 1.\n\n// Write complete Verilog code that represents this FSM.

The only indication is that the first byte of each three byte message always has in[3]=1 (but in[3] of the other two bytes may be 1 or 0 depending on data). We want a finite state machine that will search for message boundaries when given an input byte stream. The algorithm we'll use is to discard bytes until we see one with in[3]=1. We then assume that this is byte 1 of a message, and signal the receipt of a message once all 3 bytes have been received (done).

The FSM has inputs x and y, which come from the motor, and produces outputs f and g, which control the motor. There is also a clock input called clk and a reset input (synchronous, active low) called resetn. The FSM has to work as follows. As long as the reset input is asserted, the FSM stays in a beginning state, called state A. When the reset signal is de-asserted, then after the next clock edge the FSM has to set the output f to 1 for one clock cycle. Then, the FSM has to monitor the x input. When x has produced the values 1, 0, 1 in three successive clock cycles, then g should be set to 1 on the following clock cycle. While maintaining g = 1 the FSM has to monitor the y input. If y has the value 1 within at most two clock cycles, then the FSM should maintain g = 1 permanently (that is, until reset).

Provide the Verilog code design directly.\n\nA large reservior of water serves several users. In order to keep the level of water succificently high, three sensors are placed vertically at 5-inch intervals. When the water level is above the highest sensor s[3], the input flow rate should be zero. When the level is below the lowest sensor s[1], the flow rate should be at maximum (both Nominal flow valve and Supplemental flow valve opened). The flow rate when the level is between the upper and lower sensors is determined by two factors: the water level and the level previous to the last sensor change. Each water level has a nominal flow rate associated with it as show in the table below. If the sensor change indicates that the previous level was lower than the current level, the flow rate should be increased by opening the Supplemental flow valve (controlled by dfr). \n// Water Level | Sensors Asserted | Nominal Flow Rate Inputs to be Asserted\n// Above s[3] | s[1], s[2], s[3] | None\n// Between s[3] and s[2] | s[1], s[2] | fr1\n// Between s[2] and s[1]  | s[1] | fr1, fr2\n// Below s[1] | None | fr1, fr2, fr3\n// Also include an active-high synchronous reset that resets the state machine to a state equivalent to if the water level had been low for a long time (no sensors asserted, and all four outputs asserted).\nPlease complete the Verilog code below and return the complete module code.

{"task_id": "gshare", "description": "You are a Verilog expert. Be concise and focused on the key points and avoid repetitive thoughts. Provide the Verilog code design directly.\n\nBuild a gshare branch predictor with 7-bit pc and 7-bit global history, hashed (using xor) into a 7-bit index. This index accesses a 128-entry table of two-bit saturating counters. The branch predictor should contain a 7-bit global branch history register. The branch predictor has two sets of interfaces: One for doing predictions and one for doing training. The prediction interface is used in the processor's Fetch stage to ask the branch predictor for branch direction predictions for the instructions being fetched. Once these branches proceed down the pipeline and are executed, the true outcomes of the branches become known. The branch predictor is then trained using the actual branch direction outcomes. \n// When a branch prediction is requested (predict_valid = 1) for a given pc, the branch predictor produces the predicted branch direction and state of the branch history register used to make the prediction. The branch history register is then updated (at the next positive clock edge) for the predicted branch. \n// When training for a branch is requested (train_valid = 1), the branch predictor is told the pc and branch history register value for the branch that is being trained, as well as the actual branch outcome and whether the branch was a misprediction (needing a pipeline flush). Update the pattern history table (PHT) to train the branch predictor to predict this branch more accurately next time. In addition, if the branch being trained is mispredicted, also recover the branch history register to the state immediately after the mispredicting branch completes execution.\n// If training for a misprediction and a prediction (for a different, younger instruction) occurs in the same cycle, both operations will want to modify the branch history register. When this happens, training takes precedence, because the branch being predicted will be discarded anyway. If training and prediction of the same PHT entry happen at the same time, the prediction sees the PHT state before training because training only modifies the PHT at the next positive clock edge. The following timing diagram shows the timing when training and predicting PHT entry 0 at the same time. The training request at cycle 4 changes the PHT entry state in cycle 5, but the prediction request in cycle 4 outputs the PHT state at cycle 4, without considering the effect of the training request in cycle 4.

Provide the Verilog code design directly.\n\nThe game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left (walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it's bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left. If it's bumped on both sides at the same time, it will still switch directions. \n// In addition to walking left and right and changing direction when bumped, when ground=0, the Lemming will fall and say \"\"aaah!\"\". When the ground reappears (ground=1), the Lemming will resume walking in the same direction as before the fall. Being bumped while falling does not affect the walking direction, and being bumped in the same cycle as ground disappears (but not yet falling), or when the ground reappears while still falling, also does not affect the walking direction.\n// In addition to walking and falling, Lemmings can sometimes be told to do useful things, like dig (it starts digging when dig=1). A Lemming can dig if it is currently walking on ground (ground=1 and not falling), and will continue digging until it reaches the other side (ground=0). At that point, since there is no ground, it will fall (aaah!), then continue walking in its original direction once it hits ground again. As with falling, being bumped while digging has no effect, and being told to dig when falling or when there is no ground is ignored. (In other words, a walking Lemming can fall, dig, or switch directions. If more than one of these conditions are satisfied, fall has higher precedence than dig, which has higher precedence than switching directions.)\n// Although Lemmings can walk, fall, and dig, Lemmings aren't invulnerable. If a Lemming falls for too long then hits the ground, it can splatter. In particular, if a Lemming falls for more than 20 clock cycles then hits the ground, it will splatter and cease walking, falling, or digging (all 4 outputs become 0), forever (Or until the FSM gets reset). There is no upper limit on how far a Lemming can fall before hitting the ground. Lemmings only splatter when hitting the ground; they do not splatter in mid-air.\n// Implement a Moore state machine that models this behaviour. areset is positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk left.\nPlease complete the Verilog code below and return the complete module code.

You may output anything at other times (i.e., don't-care). \n\n// Waveform example:\n// time            clk             reset           in[7:0]         done            out_bytes       \n// 0ns             0               1                0              x                    x          \n// 5ns             1               1                0              0                    x          \n// 10ns            0               1                0              0                    x          \n// 15ns            1               0               2c              0                    x          \n// 20ns            0               0               2c              0                    x          \n// 25ns            1               0               81              0                    x          \n// 30ns            0               0               81              0                    x          \n// 35ns            1               0                9              0                    x          \n// 40ns            0               0                9              0                    x          \n// 45ns            1               0               6b              1               2c8109          \n// 50ns            0               0               6b              1               2c8109          \n// 55ns            1               0                d              0                    x          \n// 60ns            0               0                d              0                    x          \n// 65ns            1               0               8d              0                    x          \n// 70ns            0               0               8d              0                    x          \n// 75ns            1               0               6d              1               6b0d8d          \n// 80ns            0               0               6d              1               6b0d8d          \n// 85ns            1               0               12              0                    x          \n// 90ns            0               0               12              0                    x          \n// 95ns            1               0                1              0                    x          \n// 100ns           0               0                1              0                    x          \n// 105ns           1               0                d              1               6d1201          \n// 110ns           0               0                d              1               6d1201          \n// 115ns           1               0               76              0                    x          \n// 120ns           0               0               76              0                    x          \n// 125ns           1               0               3d              0                    x          \n// 130ns           0               0               3d              0                    x          \n// 135ns           1               0               ed              1                d763d          \n// 140ns           0               0               ed              1                d763d          \n// 145ns           1               0               8c              0                    x          \n// 150ns           0               0               8c              0                    x          \n// 155ns           1               0               f9              0                    x          \n// 160ns           0               0               f9              0                    x          \n// 165ns           1               0               ce              1               ed8cf9          \n// 170ns           0               0               ce              1               ed8cf9          \n// 175ns           1               0               c5              0                    x          \n// 180ns           0               0               c5              0                    x          \n// 185ns           1               0               aa              0                    x          \n// 190ns           0               0               aa              0                    x          \nPlease complete the Verilog code below and return the complete module code.

Implement a circuit that will turn on and off the heater, air conditioning, and blower fan as appropriate. The thermostat can be in one of two modes: heating (mode = 1) and cooling (mode = 0). In heating mode, turn the heater on when it is too cold (too_cold = 1) but do not use the air conditioner. In cooling mode, turn the air conditioner on when it is too hot (too_hot = 1), but do not turn on the heater. When the heater or air conditioner are on, also turn on the fan to circulate the air.

This FSM acts as an arbiter circuit, which controls access to some type of resource by three requesting devices. Each device makes its request for the resource by setting a signal _r[i]_ = 1, where _r[i]_ is either _r[1]_, _r[2]_, or _r[3]_. Each r[i] is an input signal to the FSM, and represents one of the three devices. The FSM stays in state _A_ as long as there are no requests. When one or more request occurs, then the FSM decides which device receives a grant to use the resource and changes to a state that sets that device's _g[i]_ signal to 1. Each _g[i]_ is an output from the FSM. There is a priority system, in that device 1 has a higher priority than device 2, and device 3 has the lowest priority. Hence, for example, device 3 will only receive a grant if it is the only device making a request when the FSM is in state _A_. Once a device, _i_, is given a grant by the FSM, that device continues to receive the grant as long as its request, _r[i]_ = 1.\n\n// Write complete Verilog code that represents this FSM.

The only indication is that the first byte of each three byte message always has in[3]=1 (but in[3] of the other two bytes may be 1 or 0 depending on data). We want a finite state machine that will search for message boundaries when given an input byte stream. The algorithm we'll use is to discard bytes until we see one with in[3]=1. We then assume that this is byte 1 of a message, and signal the receipt of a message once all 3 bytes have been received (done).

The FSM has inputs x and y, which come from the motor, and produces outputs f and g, which control the motor. There is also a clock input called clk and a reset input (synchronous, active low) called resetn. The FSM has to work as follows. As long as the reset input is asserted, the FSM stays in a beginning state, called state A. When the reset signal is de-asserted, then after the next clock edge the FSM has to set the output f to 1 for one clock cycle. Then, the FSM has to monitor the x input. When x has produced the values 1, 0, 1 in three successive clock cycles, then g should be set to 1 on the following clock cycle. While maintaining g = 1 the FSM has to monitor the y input. If y has the value 1 within at most two clock cycles, then the FSM should maintain g = 1 permanently (that is, until reset).

Seeing exactly 6 consecutive 1s (i.e., 01111110) is a \"flag\" that indicate frame boundaries. To avoid the data stream from accidentally containing \"flags\", the sender inserts a zero after every 5 consecutive 1s which the receiver must detect and discard.

Create a Moore-type finite state machine to recognize these three sequences:\n\n// (1) 0111110: Signal a bit needs to be discarded (disc).\n// (2) 01111110: Flag the beginning/end of a frame (flag).\n// (3) 01111111...: Error (7 or more 1s) (err).\n\n// When the FSM is reset, it should be in a state that behaves as though the previous input were 0.

In order to keep the level of water succificently high, three sensors are placed vertically at 5-inch intervals. When the water level is above the highest sensor s[3], the input flow rate should be zero. When the level is below the lowest sensor s[1], the flow rate should be at maximum (both Nominal flow valve and Supplemental flow valve opened). The flow rate when the level is between the upper and lower sensors is determined by two factors: the water level and the level previous to the last sensor change. Each water level has a nominal flow rate associated with it as show in the table below. If the sensor change indicates that the previous level was lower than the current level, the flow rate should be increased by opening the Supplemental flow valve (controlled by dfr). \n// Water Level | Sensors Asserted | Nominal Flow Rate Inputs to be Asserted\n// Above s[3] | s[1], s[2], s[3] | None\n// Between s[3] and s[2] | s[1], s[2] | fr1\n// Between s[2] and s[1]  | s[1] | fr1, fr2\n// Below s[1] | None | fr1, fr2, fr3\n// Also include an active-high synchronous reset that resets the state machine to a state equivalent to if the water level had been low for a long time (no sensors asserted, and all four outputs asserted).\nPlease complete the Verilog code below and return the complete module code.

{"task_id": "gshare", "description": "You are a Verilog expert. Be concise and focused on the key points and avoid repetitive thoughts. Provide the Verilog code design directly.\n\nBuild a gshare branch predictor with 7-bit pc and 7-bit global history, hashed (using xor) into a 7-bit index. This index accesses a 128-entry table of two-bit saturating counters. The branch predictor should contain a 7-bit global branch history register. The branch predictor has two sets of interfaces: One for doing predictions and one for doing training. The prediction interface is used in the processor's Fetch stage to ask the branch predictor for branch direction predictions for the instructions being fetched. Once these branches proceed down the pipeline and are executed, the true outcomes of the branches become known. The branch predictor is then trained using the actual branch direction outcomes. \n// When a branch prediction is requested (predict_valid = 1) for a given pc, the branch predictor produces the predicted branch direction and state of the branch history register used to make the prediction. The branch history register is then updated (at the next positive clock edge) for the predicted branch. \n// When training for a branch is requested (train_valid = 1), the branch predictor is told the pc and branch history register value for the branch that is being trained, as well as the actual branch outcome and whether the branch was a misprediction (needing a pipeline flush). Update the pattern history table (PHT) to train the branch predictor to predict this branch more accurately next time. In addition, if the branch being trained is mispredicted, also recover the branch history register to the state immediately after the mispredicting branch completes execution.\n// If training for a misprediction and a prediction (for a different, younger instruction) occurs in the same cycle, both operations will want to modify the branch history register. When this happens, training takes precedence, because the branch being predicted will be discarded anyway. If training and prediction of the same PHT entry happen at the same time, the prediction sees the PHT state before training because training only modifies the PHT at the next positive clock edge. The following timing diagram shows the timing when training and predicting PHT entry 0 at the same time. The training request at cycle 4 changes the PHT entry state in cycle 5, but the prediction request in cycle 4 outputs the PHT state at cycle 4, without considering the effect of the training request in cycle 4.

Provide the Verilog code design directly.\n\nThe game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left (walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it's bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left. If it's bumped on both sides at the same time, it will still switch directions. \n// In addition to walking left and right and changing direction when bumped, when ground=0, the Lemming will fall and say \"\"aaah!\"\". When the ground reappears (ground=1), the Lemming will resume walking in the same direction as before the fall. Being bumped while falling does not affect the walking direction, and being bumped in the same cycle as ground disappears (but not yet falling), or when the ground reappears while still falling, also does not affect the walking direction.\n// In addition to walking and falling, Lemmings can sometimes be told to do useful things, like dig (it starts digging when dig=1). A Lemming can dig if it is currently walking on ground (ground=1 and not falling), and will continue digging until it reaches the other side (ground=0). At that point, since there is no ground, it will fall (aaah!), then continue walking in its original direction once it hits ground again. As with falling, being bumped while digging has no effect, and being told to dig when falling or when there is no ground is ignored. (In other words, a walking Lemming can fall, dig, or switch directions. If more than one of these conditions are satisfied, fall has higher precedence than dig, which has higher precedence than switching directions.)\n// Although Lemmings can walk, fall, and dig, Lemmings aren't invulnerable. If a Lemming falls for too long then hits the ground, it can splatter. In particular, if a Lemming falls for more than 20 clock cycles then hits the ground, it will splatter and cease walking, falling, or digging (all 4 outputs become 0), forever (Or until the FSM gets reset). There is no upper limit on how far a Lemming can fall before hitting the ground.

{"task_id": "lemmings3", "description": "You are a Verilog expert. Be concise and focused on the key points and avoid repetitive thoughts. Provide the Verilog code design directly.\n\nThe game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left (walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it's bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left. If it's bumped on both sides at the same time, it will still switch directions. \n// In addition to walking left and right and changing direction when bumped, when ground=0, the Lemming will fall and say \"aaah!\". When the ground reappears (ground=1), the Lemming will resume walking in the same direction as before the fall. Being bumped while falling does not affect the walking direction, and being bumped in the same cycle as ground disappears (but not yet falling), or when the ground reappears while still falling, also does not affect the walking direction.\n// In addition to walking and falling, Lemmings can sometimes be told to do useful things, like dig (it starts digging when dig=1). A Lemming can dig if it is currently walking on ground (ground=1 and not falling), and will continue digging until it reaches the other side (ground=0). At that point, since there is no ground, it will fall (aaah!), then continue walking in its original direction once it hits ground again. As with falling, being bumped while digging has no effect, and being told to dig when falling or when there is no ground is ignored. (In other words, a walking Lemming can fall, dig, or switch directions. If more than one of these conditions are satisfied, fall has higher precedence than dig, which has higher precedence than switching directions.)\n// Implement a Moore state machine that models this behaviour. areset is positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk left.\nPlease complete the Verilog code below and return the complete module code.

You may output anything at other times (i.e., don't-care). \n\n// Waveform example:\n// time            clk             reset           in[7:0]         done            out_bytes       \n// 0ns             0               1                0              x                    x          \n// 5ns             1               1                0              0                    x          \n// 10ns            0               1                0              0                    x          \n// 15ns            1               0               2c              0                    x          \n// 20ns            0               0               2c              0                    x          \n// 25ns            1               0               81              0                    x          \n// 30ns            0               0               81              0                    x          \n// 35ns            1               0                9              0                    x          \n// 40ns            0               0                9              0                    x          \n// 45ns            1               0               6b              1               2c8109          \n// 50ns            0               0               6b              1               2c8109          \n// 55ns            1               0                d              0                    x          \n// 60ns            0               0                d              0                    x          \n// 65ns            1               0               8d              0                    x          \n// 70ns            0               0               8d              0                    x          \n// 75ns            1               0               6d              1               6b0d8d          \n// 80ns            0               0               6d              1               6b0d8d          \n// 85ns            1               0               12              0                    x          \n// 90ns            0               0               12              0                    x          \n// 95ns            1               0                1              0                    x          \n// 100ns           0               0                1              0                    x          \n// 105ns           1               0                d              1               6d1201          \n// 110ns           0               0                d              1               6d1201          \n// 115ns           1               0               76              0                    x          \n// 120ns           0               0               76              0                    x          \n// 125ns           1               0               3d              0                    x          \n// 130ns           0               0               3d              0                    x          \n// 135ns           1               0               ed              1                d763d          \n// 140ns           0               0               ed              1                d763d          \n// 145ns           1               0               8c              0                    x          \n// 150ns           0               0               8c              0                    x          \n// 155ns           1               0               f9              0                    x          \n// 160ns           0               0               f9              0                    x          \n// 165ns           1               0               ce              1               ed8cf9          \n// 170ns           0               0               ce              1               ed8cf9          \n// 175ns           1               0               c5              0                    x          \n// 180ns           0               0               c5              0                    x          \n// 185ns           1               0               aa              0                    x          \n// 190ns           0               0               aa              0                    x          \nPlease complete the Verilog code below and return the complete module code.

This FSM acts as an arbiter circuit, which controls access to some type of resource by three requesting devices. Each device makes its request for the resource by setting a signal _r[i]_ = 1, where _r[i]_ is either _r[1]_, _r[2]_, or _r[3]_. Each r[i] is an input signal to the FSM, and represents one of the three devices. The FSM stays in state _A_ as long as there are no requests. When one or more request occurs, then the FSM decides which device receives a grant to use the resource and changes to a state that sets that device's _g[i]_ signal to 1. Each _g[i]_ is an output from the FSM. There is a priority system, in that device 1 has a higher priority than device 2, and device 3 has the lowest priority. Hence, for example, device 3 will only receive a grant if it is the only device making a request when the FSM is in state _A_. Once a device, _i_, is given a grant by the FSM, that device continues to receive the grant as long as its request, _r[i]_ = 1.\n\n// Write complete Verilog code that represents this FSM.

Provide the Verilog code design directly.\n\nConsider a finite state machine that is used to control some type of motor. The FSM has inputs x and y, which come from the motor, and produces outputs f and g, which control the motor. There is also a clock input called clk and a reset input (synchronous, active low) called resetn. The FSM has to work as follows. As long as the reset input is asserted, the FSM stays in a beginning state, called state A. When the reset signal is de-asserted, then after the next clock edge the FSM has to set the output f to 1 for one clock cycle. Then, the FSM has to monitor the x input. When x has produced the values 1, 0, 1 in three successive clock cycles, then g should be set to 1 on the following clock cycle. While maintaining g = 1 the FSM has to monitor the y input. If y has the value 1 within at most two clock cycles, then the FSM should maintain g = 1 permanently (that is, until reset). But if y does not become 1 within two clock cycles, then the FSM should set g = 0 permanently (until reset).\nPlease complete the Verilog code below and return the complete module code.

This is done by replicating the sign bit (the most significant bit) of the smaller number to the left. For example, sign-extending 4'b0101 (5) to 8 bits results in 8'b00000101 (5), while sign-extending 4'b1101 (-3) to 8 bits results in 8'b11111101 (-3).

Seeing exactly 6 consecutive 1s (i.e., 01111110) is a \"flag\" that indicate frame boundaries. To avoid the data stream from accidentally containing \"flags\", the sender inserts a zero after every 5 consecutive 1s which the receiver must detect and discard. We also need to signal an error if there are 7 or more consecutive 1s. Create a Moore-type finite state machine to recognize these three sequences:\n\n// (1) 0111110: Signal a bit needs to be discarded (disc).\n// (2) 01111110: Flag the beginning/end of a frame (flag).\n// (3) 01111111...: Error (7 or more 1s) (err).\n\n// When the FSM is reset, it should be in a state that behaves as though the previous input were 0.

In order to keep the level of water succificently high, three sensors are placed vertically at 5-inch intervals. When the water level is above the highest sensor s[3], the input flow rate should be zero. When the level is below the lowest sensor s[1], the flow rate should be at maximum (both Nominal flow valve and Supplemental flow valve opened). The flow rate when the level is between the upper and lower sensors is determined by two factors: the water level and the level previous to the last sensor change. Each water level has a nominal flow rate associated with it as show in the table below. If the sensor change indicates that the previous level was lower than the current level, the flow rate should be increased by opening the Supplemental flow valve (controlled by dfr). \n// Water Level | Sensors Asserted | Nominal Flow Rate Inputs to be Asserted\n// Above s[3] | s[1], s[2], s[3] | None\n// Between s[3] and s[2] | s[1], s[2] | fr1\n// Between s[2] and s[1]  | s[1] | fr1, fr2\n// Below s[1] | None | fr1, fr2, fr3\n// Also include an active-high synchronous reset that resets the state machine to a state equivalent to if the water level had been low for a long time (no sensors asserted, and all four outputs asserted).\nPlease complete the Verilog code below and return the complete module code.

Provide the Verilog code design directly.\n\nIn many (older) serial communications protocols, each data byte is sent along with a start bit and a stop bit, to help the receiver delimit bytes from the stream of bits. One common scheme is to use one start bit (0), 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit (1). The line is also at logic 1 when nothing is being transmitted (idle). Design a finite state machine that will identify when bytes have been correctly received when given a stream of bits.

{"task_id": "gshare", "description": "You are a Verilog expert. Be concise and focused on the key points and avoid repetitive thoughts. Provide the Verilog code design directly.\n\nBuild a gshare branch predictor with 7-bit pc and 7-bit global history, hashed (using xor) into a 7-bit index. This index accesses a 128-entry table of two-bit saturating counters. The branch predictor should contain a 7-bit global branch history register. The branch predictor has two sets of interfaces: One for doing predictions and one for doing training. The prediction interface is used in the processor's Fetch stage to ask the branch predictor for branch direction predictions for the instructions being fetched. Once these branches proceed down the pipeline and are executed, the true outcomes of the branches become known. The branch predictor is then trained using the actual branch direction outcomes. \n// When a branch prediction is requested (predict_valid = 1) for a given pc, the branch predictor produces the predicted branch direction and state of the branch history register used to make the prediction. The branch history register is then updated (at the next positive clock edge) for the predicted branch. \n// When training for a branch is requested (train_valid = 1), the branch predictor is told the pc and branch history register value for the branch that is being trained, as well as the actual branch outcome and whether the branch was a misprediction (needing a pipeline flush). Update the pattern history table (PHT) to train the branch predictor to predict this branch more accurately next time. In addition, if the branch being trained is mispredicted, also recover the branch history register to the state immediately after the mispredicting branch completes execution.\n// If training for a misprediction and a prediction (for a different, younger instruction) occurs in the same cycle, both operations will want to modify the branch history register. When this happens, training takes precedence, because the branch being predicted will be discarded anyway. If training and prediction of the same PHT entry happen at the same time, the prediction sees the PHT state before training because training only modifies the PHT at the next positive clock edge. The following timing diagram shows the timing when training and predicting PHT entry 0 at the same time. The training request at cycle 4 changes the PHT entry state in cycle 5, but the prediction request in cycle 4 outputs the PHT state at cycle 4, without considering the effect of the training request in cycle 4.

In the Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left (walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it's bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left. If it's bumped on both sides at the same time, it will still switch directions. \n// In addition to walking left and right and changing direction when bumped, when ground=0, the Lemming will fall and say \"aaah!\". When the ground reappears (ground=1), the Lemming will resume walking in the same direction as before the fall.

You may output anything at other times (i.e., don't-care). \n\n// Waveform example:\n// time            clk             reset           in[7:0]         done            out_bytes       \n// 0ns             0               1                0              x                    x          \n// 5ns             1               1                0              0                    x          \n// 10ns            0               1                0              0                    x          \n// 15ns            1               0               2c              0                    x          \n// 20ns            0               0               2c              0                    x          \n// 25ns            1               0               81              0                    x          \n// 30ns            0               0               81              0                    x          \n// 35ns            1               0                9              0                    x          \n// 40ns            0               0                9              0                    x          \n// 45ns            1               0               6b              1               2c8109          \n// 50ns            0               0               6b              1               2c8109          \n// 55ns            1               0                d              0                    x          \n// 60ns            0               0                d              0                    x          \n// 65ns            1               0               8d              0                    x          \n// 70ns            0               0               8d              0                    x          \n// 75ns            1               0               6d              1               6b0d8d          \n// 80ns            0               0               6d              1               6b0d8d          \n// 85ns            1               0               12              0                    x          \n// 90ns            0               0               12              0                    x          \n// 95ns            1               0                1              0                    x          \n// 100ns           0               0                1              0                    x          \n// 105ns           1               0                d              1               6d1201          \n// 110ns           0               0                d              1               6d1201          \n// 115ns           1               0               76              0                    x          \n// 120ns           0               0               76              0                    x          \n// 125ns           1               0               3d              0                    x          \n// 130ns           0               0               3d              0                    x          \n// 135ns           1               0               ed              1                d763d          \n// 140ns           0               0               ed              1                d763d          \n// 145ns           1               0               8c              0                    x          \n// 150ns           0               0               8c              0                    x          \n// 155ns           1               0               f9              0                    x          \n// 160ns           0               0               f9              0                    x          \n// 165ns           1               0               ce              1               ed8cf9          \n// 170ns           0               0               ce              1               ed8cf9          \n// 175ns           1               0               c5              0                    x          \n// 180ns           0               0               c5              0                    x          \n// 185ns           1               0               aa              0                    x          \n// 190ns           0               0               aa              0                    x          \nPlease complete the Verilog code below and return the complete module code.

When a branch prediction is made (predict_valid = 1), shift in predict_taken from the LSB side to update the branch history for the predicted branch.

This is the history before the mispredicted branch (train_history) concatenated with the actual result of the branch (train_taken).

At each clock cycle: \n// (1) If load = 1, load the internal counter with the 10-bit data, the number of clock cycles the timer should count before timing out. The counter can be loaded at any time, including when it is still counting and has not yet reached 0. \n// (2) If load = 0, the internal counter should decrement by 1. The output signal tc (\"terminal count\") indicates whether the internal counter has reached 0. Once the internal counter has reached 0, it should stay 0 (stop counting) until the counter is loaded again.\n\n\nPlease complete the Verilog code below and return the complete module code.

This FSM acts as an arbiter circuit, which controls access to some type of resource by three requesting devices. Each device makes its request for the resource by setting a signal _r[i]_ = 1, where _r[i]_ is either _r[1]_, _r[2]_, or _r[3]_. Each r[i] is an input signal to the FSM, and represents one of the three devices. The FSM stays in state _A_ as long as there are no requests. When one or more request occurs, then the FSM decides which device receives a grant to use the resource and changes to a state that sets that device's _g[i]_ signal to 1. Each _g[i]_ is an output from the FSM. There is a priority system, in that device 1 has a higher priority than device 2, and device 3 has the lowest priority. Hence, for example, device 3 will only receive a grant if it is the only device making a request when the FSM is in state _A_. Once a device, _i_, is given a grant by the FSM, that device continues to receive the grant as long as its request, _r[i]_ = 1.\n\n// Write complete Verilog code that represents this FSM.

The FSM has inputs x and y, which come from the motor, and produces outputs f and g, which control the motor. There is also a clock input called clk and a reset input (synchronous, active low) called resetn. The FSM has to work as follows. As long as the reset input is asserted, the FSM stays in a beginning state, called state A. When the reset signal is de-asserted, then after the next clock edge the FSM has to set the output f to 1 for one clock cycle. Then, the FSM has to monitor the x input. When x has produced the values 1, 0, 1 in three successive clock cycles, then g should be set to 1 on the following clock cycle. While maintaining g = 1 the FSM has to monitor the y input. If y has the value 1 within at most two clock cycles, then the FSM should maintain g = 1 permanently (that is, until reset).

When the level is below the lowest sensor s[1], the flow rate should be at maximum (both Nominal flow valve and Supplemental flow valve opened). The flow rate when the level is between the upper and lower sensors is determined by two factors: the water level and the level previous to the last sensor change. Each water level has a nominal flow rate associated with it as show in the table below. If the sensor change indicates that the previous level was lower than the current level, the flow rate should be increased by opening the Supplemental flow valve (controlled by dfr). \n// Water Level | Sensors Asserted | Nominal Flow Rate Inputs to be Asserted\n// Above s[3] | s[1], s[2], s[3] | None\n// Between s[3] and s[2] | s[1], s[2] | fr1\n// Between s[2] and s[1]  | s[1] | fr1, fr2\n// Below s[1] | None | fr1, fr2, fr3\n// Also include an active-high synchronous reset that resets the state machine to a state equivalent to if the water level had been low for a long time (no sensors asserted, and all four outputs asserted).\nPlease complete the Verilog code below and return the complete module code.

Provide the Verilog code design directly.\n\nBuild a gshare branch predictor with 7-bit pc and 7-bit global history, hashed (using xor) into a 7-bit index. This index accesses a 128-entry table of two-bit saturating counters. The branch predictor should contain a 7-bit global branch history register. The branch predictor has two sets of interfaces: One for doing predictions and one for doing training. The prediction interface is used in the processor's Fetch stage to ask the branch predictor for branch direction predictions for the instructions being fetched. Once these branches proceed down the pipeline and are executed, the true outcomes of the branches become known. The branch predictor is then trained using the actual branch direction outcomes. \n// When a branch prediction is requested (predict_valid = 1) for a given pc, the branch predictor produces the predicted branch direction and state of the branch history register used to make the prediction. The branch history register is then updated (at the next positive clock edge) for the predicted branch. \n// When training for a branch is requested (train_valid = 1), the branch predictor is told the pc and branch history register value for the branch that is being trained, as well as the actual branch outcome and whether the branch was a misprediction (needing a pipeline flush). Update the pattern history table (PHT) to train the branch predictor to predict this branch more accurately next time. In addition, if the branch being trained is mispredicted, also recover the branch history register to the state immediately after the mispredicting branch completes execution.\n// If training for a misprediction and a prediction (for a different, younger instruction) occurs in the same cycle, both operations will want to modify the branch history register. When this happens, training takes precedence, because the branch being predicted will be discarded anyway. If training and prediction of the same PHT entry happen at the same time, the prediction sees the PHT state before training because training only modifies the PHT at the next positive clock edge. The following timing diagram shows the timing when training and predicting PHT entry 0 at the same time.

In particular, if a Lemming is bumped on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it's bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left.

In the Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left (walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it's bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left. If it's bumped on both sides at the same time, it will still switch directions. \n// In addition to walking left and right and changing direction when bumped, when ground=0, the Lemming will fall and say \"aaah!\". When the ground reappears (ground=1), the Lemming will resume walking in the same direction as before the fall. Being bumped while falling does not affect the walking direction, and being bumped in the same cycle as ground disappears (but not yet falling), or when the ground reappears while still falling, also does not affect the walking direction.\n// Implement a Moore state machine that models this behaviour. areset is positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk left.\nPlease complete the Verilog code below and return the complete module code.

You may output anything at other times (i.e., don't-care). \n\n// Waveform example:\n// time            clk             reset           in[7:0]         done            out_bytes       \n// 0ns             0               1                0              x                    x          \n// 5ns             1               1                0              0                    x          \n// 10ns            0               1                0              0                    x          \n// 15ns            1               0               2c              0                    x          \n// 20ns            0               0               2c              0                    x          \n// 25ns            1               0               81              0                    x          \n// 30ns            0               0               81              0                    x          \n// 35ns            1               0                9              0                    x          \n// 40ns            0               0                9              0                    x          \n// 45ns            1               0               6b              1               2c8109          \n// 50ns            0               0               6b              1               2c8109          \n// 55ns            1               0                d              0                    x          \n// 60ns            0               0                d              0                    x          \n// 65ns            1               0               8d              0                    x          \n// 70ns            0               0               8d              0                    x          \n// 75ns            1               0               6d              1               6b0d8d          \n// 80ns            0               0               6d              1               6b0d8d          \n// 85ns            1               0               12              0                    x          \n// 90ns            0               0               12              0                    x          \n// 95ns            1               0                1              0                    x          \n// 100ns           0               0                1              0                    x          \n// 105ns           1               0                d              1               6d1201          \n// 110ns           0               0                d              1               6d1201          \n// 115ns           1               0               76              0                    x          \n// 120ns           0               0               76              0                    x          \n// 125ns           1               0               3d              0                    x          \n// 130ns           0               0               3d              0                    x          \n// 135ns           1               0               ed              1                d763d          \n// 140ns           0               0               ed              1                d763d          \n// 145ns           1               0               8c              0                    x          \n// 150ns           0               0               8c              0                    x          \n// 155ns           1               0               f9              0                    x          \n// 160ns           0               0               f9              0                    x          \n// 165ns           1               0               ce              1               ed8cf9          \n// 170ns           0               0               ce              1               ed8cf9          \n// 175ns           1               0               c5              0                    x          \n// 180ns           0               0               c5              0                    x          \n// 185ns           1               0               aa              0                    x          \n// 190ns           0               0               aa              0                    x          \nPlease complete the Verilog code below and return the complete module code.

This FSM acts as an arbiter circuit, which controls access to some type of resource by three requesting devices. Each device makes its request for the resource by setting a signal _r[i]_ = 1, where _r[i]_ is either _r[1]_, _r[2]_, or _r[3]_. Each r[i] is an input signal to the FSM, and represents one of the three devices. The FSM stays in state _A_ as long as there are no requests. When one or more request occurs, then the FSM decides which device receives a grant to use the resource and changes to a state that sets that device's _g[i]_ signal to 1. Each _g[i]_ is an output from the FSM. There is a priority system, in that device 1 has a higher priority than device 2, and device 3 has the lowest priority. Hence, for example, device 3 will only receive a grant if it is the only device making a request when the FSM is in state _A_. Once a device, _i_, is given a grant by the FSM, that device continues to receive the grant as long as its request, _r[i]_ = 1.\n\n// Write complete Verilog code that represents this FSM.

The only indication is that the first byte of each three byte message always has in[3]=1 (but in[3] of the other two bytes may be 1 or 0 depending on data). We want a finite state machine that will search for message boundaries when given an input byte stream. The algorithm we'll use is to discard bytes until we see one with in[3]=1. We then assume that this is byte 1 of a message, and signal the receipt of a message once all 3 bytes have been received (done). The FSM should signal done in the cycle immediately after the third byte of each message was successfully received.

Provide the Verilog code design directly.\n\nConsider a finite state machine that is used to control some type of motor. The FSM has inputs x and y, which come from the motor, and produces outputs f and g, which control the motor. There is also a clock input called clk and a reset input (synchronous, active low) called resetn. The FSM has to work as follows. As long as the reset input is asserted, the FSM stays in a beginning state, called state A. When the reset signal is de-asserted, then after the next clock edge the FSM has to set the output f to 1 for one clock cycle. Then, the FSM has to monitor the x input. When x has produced the values 1, 0, 1 in three successive clock cycles, then g should be set to 1 on the following clock cycle. While maintaining g = 1 the FSM has to monitor the y input. If y has the value 1 within at most two clock cycles, then the FSM should maintain g = 1 permanently (that is, until reset). But if y does not become 1 within two clock cycles, then the FSM should set g = 0 permanently (until reset).\nPlease complete the Verilog code below and return the complete module code.

Seeing exactly 6 consecutive 1s (i.e., 01111110) is a \"flag\" that indicate frame boundaries. To avoid the data stream from accidentally containing \"flags\", the sender inserts a zero after every 5 consecutive 1s which the receiver must detect and discard.

In order to keep the level of water succificently high, three sensors are placed vertically at 5-inch intervals. When the water level is above the highest sensor s[3], the input flow rate should be zero. When the level is below the lowest sensor s[1], the flow rate should be at maximum (both Nominal flow valve and Supplemental flow valve opened). The flow rate when the level is between the upper and lower sensors is determined by two factors: the water level and the level previous to the last sensor change. Each water level has a nominal flow rate associated with it as show in the table below. If the sensor change indicates that the previous level was lower than the current level, the flow rate should be increased by opening the Supplemental flow valve (controlled by dfr). \n// Water Level | Sensors Asserted | Nominal Flow Rate Inputs to be Asserted\n// Above s[3] | s[1], s[2], s[3] | None\n// Between s[3] and s[2] | s[1], s[2] | fr1\n// Between s[2] and s[1]  | s[1] | fr1, fr2\n// Below s[1] | None | fr1, fr2, fr3\n// Also include an active-high synchronous reset that resets the state machine to a state equivalent to if the water level had been low for a long time (no sensors asserted, and all four outputs asserted).\nPlease complete the Verilog code below and return the complete module code.

Provide the Verilog code design directly.\n\nBuild a gshare branch predictor with 7-bit pc and 7-bit global history, hashed (using xor) into a 7-bit index. This index accesses a 128-entry table of two-bit saturating counters. The branch predictor should contain a 7-bit global branch history register. The branch predictor has two sets of interfaces: One for doing predictions and one for doing training. The prediction interface is used in the processor's Fetch stage to ask the branch predictor for branch direction predictions for the instructions being fetched. Once these branches proceed down the pipeline and are executed, the true outcomes of the branches become known. The branch predictor is then trained using the actual branch direction outcomes. \n// When a branch prediction is requested (predict_valid = 1) for a given pc, the branch predictor produces the predicted branch direction and state of the branch history register used to make the prediction. The branch history register is then updated (at the next positive clock edge) for the predicted branch. \n// When training for a branch is requested (train_valid = 1), the branch predictor is told the pc and branch history register value for the branch that is being trained, as well as the actual branch outcome and whether the branch was a misprediction (needing a pipeline flush). Update the pattern history table (PHT) to train the branch predictor to predict this branch more accurately next time. In addition, if the branch being trained is mispredicted, also recover the branch history register to the state immediately after the mispredicting branch completes execution.\n// If training for a misprediction and a prediction (for a different, younger instruction) occurs in the same cycle, both operations will want to modify the branch history register. When this happens, training takes precedence, because the branch being predicted will be discarded anyway. If training and prediction of the same PHT entry happen at the same time, the prediction sees the PHT state before training because training only modifies the PHT at the next positive clock edge. The following timing diagram shows the timing when training and predicting PHT entry 0 at the same time. The training request at cycle 4 changes the PHT entry state in cycle 5, but the prediction request in cycle 4 outputs the PHT state at cycle 4, without considering the effect of the training request in cycle 4.

Provide the Verilog code design directly.\n\nThe game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left (walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it's bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left. If it's bumped on both sides at the same time, it will still switch directions. \n// In addition to walking left and right and changing direction when bumped, when ground=0, the Lemming will fall and say \"\"aaah!\"\". When the ground reappears (ground=1), the Lemming will resume walking in the same direction as before the fall. Being bumped while falling does not affect the walking direction, and being bumped in the same cycle as ground disappears (but not yet falling), or when the ground reappears while still falling, also does not affect the walking direction.\n// In addition to walking and falling, Lemmings can sometimes be told to do useful things, like dig (it starts digging when dig=1). A Lemming can dig if it is currently walking on ground (ground=1 and not falling), and will continue digging until it reaches the other side (ground=0). At that point, since there is no ground, it will fall (aaah!), then continue walking in its original direction once it hits ground again. As with falling, being bumped while digging has no effect, and being told to dig when falling or when there is no ground is ignored. (In other words, a walking Lemming can fall, dig, or switch directions. If more than one of these conditions are satisfied, fall has higher precedence than dig, which has higher precedence than switching directions.)\n// Although Lemmings can walk, fall, and dig, Lemmings aren't invulnerable. If a Lemming falls for too long then hits the ground, it can splatter. In particular, if a Lemming falls for more than 20 clock cycles then hits the ground, it will splatter and cease walking, falling, or digging (all 4 outputs become 0), forever (Or until the FSM gets reset). There is no upper limit on how far a Lemming can fall before hitting the ground.

Provide the Verilog code design directly.\n\nWe want a finite state machine that will search for message boundaries when given an input byte stream. The algorithm we'll use is to discard bytes until we see one with in[3]=1. We then assume that this is byte 1 of a message, and signal the receipt of a message once all 3 bytes have been received (done). The FSM should signal done in the cycle immediately after the third byte of each message was successfully received.\n\n// Implement the datapath module that will output the 24-bit (3 byte) message whenever a packet is received (out_bytes[23:16] is the first byte, out_bytes[15:8] is the second byte, etc.). The reset signal is active high synchronous. out_bytes needs to be valid whenever the done signal is asserted. You may output anything at other times (i.e., don't-care). \n\n// Waveform example:\n// time            clk             reset           in[7:0]         done            out_bytes       \n// 0ns             0               1                0              x                    x          \n// 5ns             1               1                0              0                    x          \n// 10ns            0               1                0              0                    x          \n// 15ns            1               0               2c              0                    x          \n// 20ns            0               0               2c              0                    x          \n// 25ns            1               0               81              0                    x          \n// 30ns            0               0               81              0                    x          \n// 35ns            1               0                9              0                    x          \n// 40ns            0               0                9              0                    x          \n// 45ns            1               0               6b              1               2c8109          \n// 50ns            0               0               6b              1               2c8109          \n// 55ns            1               0                d              0                    x          \n// 60ns            0               0                d              0                    x          \n// 65ns            1               0               8d              0                    x          \n// 70ns            0               0               8d              0                    x          \n// 75ns            1               0               6d              1               6b0d8d          \n// 80ns            0               0               6d              1               6b0d8d          \n// 85ns            1               0               12              0                    x          \n// 90ns            0               0               12              0                    x          \n// 95ns            1               0                1              0                    x          \n// 100ns           0               0                1              0                    x          \n// 105ns           1               0                d              1               6d1201          \n// 110ns           0               0                d              1               6d1201          \n// 115ns           1               0               76              0                    x          \n// 120ns           0               0               76              0                    x          \n// 125ns           1               0               3d              0                    x          \n// 130ns           0               0               3d              0                    x          \n// 135ns           1               0               ed              1                d763d          \n// 140ns           0               0               ed              1                d763d          \n// 145ns           1               0               8c              0                    x          \n// 150ns           0               0               8c              0                    x          \n// 155ns           1               0               f9              0                    x          \n// 160ns           0               0               f9              0                    x          \n// 165ns           1               0               ce              1               ed8cf9          \n// 170ns           0               0               ce              1               ed8cf9          \n// 175ns           1               0               c5              0                    x          \n// 180ns           0               0               c5              0                    x          \n// 185ns           1               0               aa              0                    x          \n// 190ns           0               0               aa              0                    x          \nPlease complete the Verilog code below and return the complete module code.

This FSM acts as an arbiter circuit, which controls access to some type of resource by three requesting devices. Each device makes its request for the resource by setting a signal _r[i]_ = 1, where _r[i]_ is either _r[1]_, _r[2]_, or _r[3]_. Each r[i] is an input signal to the FSM, and represents one of the three devices. The FSM stays in state _A_ as long as there are no requests. When one or more request occurs, then the FSM decides which device receives a grant to use the resource and changes to a state that sets that device's _g[i]_ signal to 1. Each _g[i]_ is an output from the FSM. There is a priority system, in that device 1 has a higher priority than device 2, and device 3 has the lowest priority. Hence, for example, device 3 will only receive a grant if it is the only device making a request when the FSM is in state _A_. Once a device, _i_, is given a grant by the FSM, that device continues to receive the grant as long as its request, _r[i]_ = 1.\n\n// Write complete Verilog code that represents this FSM.

Provide the Verilog code design directly.\n\nConsider a finite state machine that is used to control some type of motor. The FSM has inputs x and y, which come from the motor, and produces outputs f and g, which control the motor. There is also a clock input called clk and a reset input (synchronous, active low) called resetn. The FSM has to work as follows. As long as the reset input is asserted, the FSM stays in a beginning state, called state A. When the reset signal is de-asserted, then after the next clock edge the FSM has to set the output f to 1 for one clock cycle. Then, the FSM has to monitor the x input. When x has produced the values 1, 0, 1 in three successive clock cycles, then g should be set to 1 on the following clock cycle. While maintaining g = 1 the FSM has to monitor the y input. If y has the value 1 within at most two clock cycles, then the FSM should maintain g = 1 permanently (that is, until reset). But if y does not become 1 within two clock cycles, then the FSM should set g = 0 permanently (until reset).\nPlease complete the Verilog code below and return the complete module code.

Provide the Verilog code design directly.\n\nSynchronous HDLC framing involves decoding a continuous bit stream of data to look for bit patterns that indicate the beginning and end of frames (packets). Seeing exactly 6 consecutive 1s (i.e., 01111110) is a \"flag\" that indicate frame boundaries. To avoid the data stream from accidentally containing \"flags\", the sender inserts a zero after every 5 consecutive 1s which the receiver must detect and discard. We also need to signal an error if there are 7 or more consecutive 1s. Create a Moore-type finite state machine to recognize these three sequences:\n\n// (1) 0111110: Signal a bit needs to be discarded (disc).\n// (2) 01111110: Flag the beginning/end of a frame (flag).\n// (3) 01111111...: Error (7 or more 1s) (err).\n\n// When the FSM is reset, it should be in a state that behaves as though the previous input were 0.

When the pattern 1101 is received, the circuit must then shift in the next 4 bits, most-significant-bit first. These 4 bits determine the duration of the timer delay, referred to as delay[3:0]. After that, the state machine asserts its counting output to indicate it is counting. Once the 1101 and delay[3:0] have been read, the circuit no longer looks at the data input until it resumes searching after everything else is done.\n\n// The state machine must count for exactly (delay[3:0] + 1) * 1000 clock cycles. e.g., delay=0 means count 1000 cycles, and delay=5 means count 6000 cycles.

This should be equal to delay for 1000 cycles, then delay-1 for 1000 cycles, and so on until it is 0 for 1000 cycles. \n\n// When the circuit isn't counting, the count[3:0] output is don't-care (whatever value is convenient for you to implement).

{"task_id": "ece241_2013_q4", "description": "You are a Verilog expert. Be concise and focused on the key points and avoid repetitive thoughts. Provide the Verilog code design directly.\n\nA large reservior of water serves several users. In order to keep the level of water succificently high, three sensors are placed vertically at 5-inch intervals. When the water level is above the highest sensor s[3], the input flow rate should be zero. When the level is below the lowest sensor s[1], the flow rate should be at maximum (both Nominal flow valve and Supplemental flow valve opened). The flow rate when the level is between the upper and lower sensors is determined by two factors: the water level and the level previous to the last sensor change. Each water level has a nominal flow rate associated with it as show in the table below. If the sensor change indicates that the previous level was lower than the current level, the flow rate should be increased by opening the Supplemental flow valve (controlled by dfr). \n// Water Level | Sensors Asserted | Nominal Flow Rate Inputs to be Asserted\n// Above s[3] | s[1], s[2], s[3] | None\n// Between s[3] and s[2] | s[1], s[2] | fr1\n// Between s[2] and s[1]  | s[1] | fr1, fr2\n// Below s[1] | None | fr1, fr2, fr3\n// Also include an active-high synchronous reset that resets the state machine to a state equivalent to if the water level had been low for a long time (no sensors asserted, and all four outputs asserted).\nPlease complete the Verilog code below and return the complete module code.

{"task_id": "gshare", "description": "You are a Verilog expert. Be concise and focused on the key points and avoid repetitive thoughts. Provide the Verilog code design directly.\n\nBuild a gshare branch predictor with 7-bit pc and 7-bit global history, hashed (using xor) into a 7-bit index. This index accesses a 128-entry table of two-bit saturating counters. The branch predictor should contain a 7-bit global branch history register. The branch predictor has two sets of interfaces: One for doing predictions and one for doing training. The prediction interface is used in the processor's Fetch stage to ask the branch predictor for branch direction predictions for the instructions being fetched. Once these branches proceed down the pipeline and are executed, the true outcomes of the branches become known. The branch predictor is then trained using the actual branch direction outcomes. \n// When a branch prediction is requested (predict_valid = 1) for a given pc, the branch predictor produces the predicted branch direction and state of the branch history register used to make the prediction. The branch history register is then updated (at the next positive clock edge) for the predicted branch. \n// When training for a branch is requested (train_valid = 1), the branch predictor is told the pc and branch history register value for the branch that is being trained, as well as the actual branch outcome and whether the branch was a misprediction (needing a pipeline flush). Update the pattern history table (PHT) to train the branch predictor to predict this branch more accurately next time. In addition, if the branch being trained is mispredicted, also recover the branch history register to the state immediately after the mispredicting branch completes execution.\n// If training for a misprediction and a prediction (for a different, younger instruction) occurs in the same cycle, both operations will want to modify the branch history register. When this happens, training takes precedence, because the branch being predicted will be discarded anyway. If training and prediction of the same PHT entry happen at the same time, the prediction sees the PHT state before training because training only modifies the PHT at the next positive clock edge. The following timing diagram shows the timing when training and predicting PHT entry 0 at the same time. The training request at cycle 4 changes the PHT entry state in cycle 5, but the prediction request in cycle 4 outputs the PHT state at cycle 4, without considering the effect of the training request in cycle 4.

Provide the Verilog code design directly.\n\nThe game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left (walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it's bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left. If it's bumped on both sides at the same time, it will still switch directions. \n// In addition to walking left and right and changing direction when bumped, when ground=0, the Lemming will fall and say \"\"aaah!\"\". When the ground reappears (ground=1), the Lemming will resume walking in the same direction as before the fall. Being bumped while falling does not affect the walking direction, and being bumped in the same cycle as ground disappears (but not yet falling), or when the ground reappears while still falling, also does not affect the walking direction.\n// In addition to walking and falling, Lemmings can sometimes be told to do useful things, like dig (it starts digging when dig=1). A Lemming can dig if it is currently walking on ground (ground=1 and not falling), and will continue digging until it reaches the other side (ground=0). At that point, since there is no ground, it will fall (aaah!), then continue walking in its original direction once it hits ground again. As with falling, being bumped while digging has no effect, and being told to dig when falling or when there is no ground is ignored. (In other words, a walking Lemming can fall, dig, or switch directions. If more than one of these conditions are satisfied, fall has higher precedence than dig, which has higher precedence than switching directions.)\n// Although Lemmings can walk, fall, and dig, Lemmings aren't invulnerable. If a Lemming falls for too long then hits the ground, it can splatter. In particular, if a Lemming falls for more than 20 clock cycles then hits the ground, it will splatter and cease walking, falling, or digging (all 4 outputs become 0), forever (Or until the FSM gets reset). There is no upper limit on how far a Lemming can fall before hitting the ground.

Provide the Verilog code design directly.\n\nThe game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left (walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it's bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left. If it's bumped on both sides at the same time, it will still switch directions. \n// In addition to walking left and right and changing direction when bumped, when ground=0, the Lemming will fall and say \"aaah!\".

Being bumped while falling does not affect the walking direction, and being bumped in the same cycle as ground disappears (but not yet falling), or when the ground reappears while still falling, also does not affect the walking direction.\n// In addition to walking and falling, Lemmings can sometimes be told to do useful things, like dig (it starts digging when dig=1). A Lemming can dig if it is currently walking on ground (ground=1 and not falling), and will continue digging until it reaches the other side (ground=0). At that point, since there is no ground, it will fall (aaah!), then continue walking in its original direction once it hits ground again. As with falling, being bumped while digging has no effect, and being told to dig when falling or when there is no ground is ignored. (In other words, a walking Lemming can fall, dig, or switch directions. If more than one of these conditions are satisfied, fall has higher precedence than dig, which has higher precedence than switching directions.)\n// Implement a Moore state machine that models this behaviour. areset is positive edge triggered asynchronous reseting the Lemming machine to walk left.\nPlease complete the Verilog code below and return the complete module code.

You may output anything at other times (i.e., don't-care). \n\n// Waveform example:\n// time            clk             reset           in[7:0]         done            out_bytes       \n// 0ns             0               1                0              x                    x          \n// 5ns             1               1                0              0                    x          \n// 10ns            0               1                0              0                    x          \n// 15ns            1               0               2c              0                    x          \n// 20ns            0               0               2c              0                    x          \n// 25ns            1               0               81              0                    x          \n// 30ns            0               0               81              0                    x          \n// 35ns            1               0                9              0                    x          \n// 40ns            0               0                9              0                    x          \n// 45ns            1               0               6b              1               2c8109          \n// 50ns            0               0               6b              1               2c8109          \n// 55ns            1               0                d              0                    x          \n// 60ns            0               0                d              0                    x          \n// 65ns            1               0               8d              0                    x          \n// 70ns            0               0               8d              0                    x          \n// 75ns            1               0               6d              1               6b0d8d          \n// 80ns            0               0               6d              1               6b0d8d          \n// 85ns            1               0               12              0                    x          \n// 90ns            0               0               12              0                    x          \n// 95ns            1               0                1              0                    x          \n// 100ns           0               0                1              0                    x          \n// 105ns           1               0                d              1               6d1201          \n// 110ns           0               0                d              1               6d1201          \n// 115ns           1               0               76              0                    x          \n// 120ns           0               0               76              0                    x          \n// 125ns           1               0               3d              0                    x          \n// 130ns           0               0               3d              0                    x          \n// 135ns           1               0               ed              1                d763d          \n// 140ns           0               0               ed              1                d763d          \n// 145ns           1               0               8c              0                    x          \n// 150ns           0               0               8c              0                    x          \n// 155ns           1               0               f9              0                    x          \n// 160ns           0               0               f9              0                    x          \n// 165ns           1               0               ce              1               ed8cf9          \n// 170ns           0               0               ce              1               ed8cf9          \n// 175ns           1               0               c5              0                    x          \n// 180ns           0               0               c5              0                    x          \n// 185ns           1               0               aa              0                    x          \n// 190ns           0               0               aa              0                    x          \nPlease complete the Verilog code below and return the complete module code.

Provide the Verilog code design directly.\n\nBuild a 32-bit global history shift register, including support for rolling back state in response to a pipeline flush caused by a branch misprediction. When a branch prediction is made (predict_valid = 1), shift in predict_taken from the LSB side to update the branch history for the predicted branch. (predict_history[0] is the direction of the youngest branch.) When a branch misprediction occurs (train_mispredicted = 1), load the branch history register with the history after the completion of the mispredicted branch. This is the history before the mispredicted branch (train_history) concatenated with the actual result of the branch (train_taken). If both a prediction and misprediction occur at the same time, the misprediction takes precedence, because the pipeline flush will also flush out the branch that is currently making a prediction. predict_history is the value of the branch history register. areset is a positive edge triggered asynchronous reset that resets the history counter to zero.\n\n\nPlease complete the Verilog code below and return the complete module code.

This FSM acts as an arbiter circuit, which controls access to some type of resource by three requesting devices. Each device makes its request for the resource by setting a signal _r[i]_ = 1, where _r[i]_ is either _r[1]_, _r[2]_, or _r[3]_. Each r[i] is an input signal to the FSM, and represents one of the three devices. The FSM stays in state _A_ as long as there are no requests. When one or more request occurs, then the FSM decides which device receives a grant to use the resource and changes to a state that sets that device's _g[i]_ signal to 1. Each _g[i]_ is an output from the FSM. There is a priority system, in that device 1 has a higher priority than device 2, and device 3 has the lowest priority. Hence, for example, device 3 will only receive a grant if it is the only device making a request when the FSM is in state _A_. Once a device, _i_, is given a grant by the FSM, that device continues to receive the grant as long as its request, _r[i]_ = 1.\n\n// Write complete Verilog code that represents this FSM.

The only indication is that the first byte of each three byte message always has in[3]=1 (but in[3] of the other two bytes may be 1 or 0 depending on data). We want a finite state machine that will search for message boundaries when given an input byte stream. The algorithm we'll use is to discard bytes until we see one with in[3]=1.

The FSM has inputs x and y, which come from the motor, and produces outputs f and g, which control the motor. There is also a clock input called clk and a reset input (synchronous, active low) called resetn. The FSM has to work as follows. As long as the reset input is asserted, the FSM stays in a beginning state, called state A. When the reset signal is de-asserted, then after the next clock edge the FSM has to set the output f to 1 for one clock cycle. Then, the FSM has to monitor the x input. When x has produced the values 1, 0, 1 in three successive clock cycles, then g should be set to 1 on the following clock cycle. While maintaining g = 1 the FSM has to monitor the y input. If y has the value 1 within at most two clock cycles, then the FSM should maintain g = 1 permanently (that is, until reset).

Provide the Verilog code design directly.\n\nYou are given a 100-bit input vector in[99:0]. We want to know some relationships between each bit and its neighbour: \n// (1) out_both: Each bit of this output vector should indicate whether both the corresponding input bit and its neighbour to the left are '1'. For example, out_both[98] should indicate if in[98] and in[99] are both 1. Since in[99] has no neighbour to the left, the answer is obvious so we don't need to know out_both[99]. \n// (2) out_any: Each bit of this output vector should indicate whether any of the corresponding input bit and its neighbour to the right are '1'. For example, out_any[2] should indicate if either in[2] or in[1] are 1. Since in[0] has no neighbour to the right, the answer is obvious so we don't need to know out_any[0]. \n// (3) out_different: Each bit of this output vector should indicate whether the corresponding input bit is different from its neighbour to the left.

In order to keep the level of water succificently high, three sensors are placed vertically at 5-inch intervals. When the water level is above the highest sensor s[3], the input flow rate should be zero. When the level is below the lowest sensor s[1], the flow rate should be at maximum (both Nominal flow valve and Supplemental flow valve opened). The flow rate when the level is between the upper and lower sensors is determined by two factors: the water level and the level previous to the last sensor change. Each water level has a nominal flow rate associated with it as show in the table below. If the sensor change indicates that the previous level was lower than the current level, the flow rate should be increased by opening the Supplemental flow valve (controlled by dfr). \n// Water Level | Sensors Asserted | Nominal Flow Rate Inputs to be Asserted\n// Above s[3] | s[1], s[2], s[3] | None\n// Between s[3] and s[2] | s[1], s[2] | fr1\n// Between s[2] and s[1]  | s[1] | fr1, fr2\n// Below s[1] | None | fr1, fr2, fr3\n// Also include an active-high synchronous reset that resets the state machine to a state equivalent to if the water level had been low for a long time (no sensors asserted, and all four outputs asserted).\nPlease complete the Verilog code below and return the complete module code.

{"task_id": "gshare", "description": "You are a Verilog expert. Be concise and focused on the key points and avoid repetitive thoughts. Provide the Verilog code design directly.\n\nBuild a gshare branch predictor with 7-bit pc and 7-bit global history, hashed (using xor) into a 7-bit index. This index accesses a 128-entry table of two-bit saturating counters. The branch predictor should contain a 7-bit global branch history register. The branch predictor has two sets of interfaces: One for doing predictions and one for doing training. The prediction interface is used in the processor's Fetch stage to ask the branch predictor for branch direction predictions for the instructions being fetched. Once these branches proceed down the pipeline and are executed, the true outcomes of the branches become known. The branch predictor is then trained using the actual branch direction outcomes. \n// When a branch prediction is requested (predict_valid = 1) for a given pc, the branch predictor produces the predicted branch direction and state of the branch history register used to make the prediction. The branch history register is then updated (at the next positive clock edge) for the predicted branch. \n// When training for a branch is requested (train_valid = 1), the branch predictor is told the pc and branch history register value for the branch that is being trained, as well as the actual branch outcome and whether the branch was a misprediction (needing a pipeline flush). Update the pattern history table (PHT) to train the branch predictor to predict this branch more accurately next time. In addition, if the branch being trained is mispredicted, also recover the branch history register to the state immediately after the mispredicting branch completes execution.\n// If training for a misprediction and a prediction (for a different, younger instruction) occurs in the same cycle, both operations will want to modify the branch history register. When this happens, training takes precedence, because the branch being predicted will be discarded anyway. If training and prediction of the same PHT entry happen at the same time, the prediction sees the PHT state before training because training only modifies the PHT at the next positive clock edge. The following timing diagram shows the timing when training and predicting PHT entry 0 at the same time. The training request at cycle 4 changes the PHT entry state in cycle 5, but the prediction request in cycle 4 outputs the PHT state at cycle 4, without considering the effect of the training request in cycle 4.

Provide the Verilog code design directly.\n\nThe game Lemmings involves critters with fairly simple brains. So simple that we are going to model it using a finite state machine. In the Lemmings' 2D world, Lemmings can be in one of two states: walking left (walk_left is 1) or walking right (walk_right is 1). It will switch directions if it hits an obstacle. In particular, if a Lemming is bumped on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it's bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left. If it's bumped on both sides at the same time, it will still switch directions. \n// In addition to walking left and right and changing direction when bumped, when ground=0, the Lemming will fall and say \"\"aaah!\"\". When the ground reappears (ground=1), the Lemming will resume walking in the same direction as before the fall. Being bumped while falling does not affect the walking direction, and being bumped in the same cycle as ground disappears (but not yet falling), or when the ground reappears while still falling, also does not affect the walking direction.\n// In addition to walking and falling, Lemmings can sometimes be told to do useful things, like dig (it starts digging when dig=1). A Lemming can dig if it is currently walking on ground (ground=1 and not falling), and will continue digging until it reaches the other side (ground=0). At that point, since there is no ground, it will fall (aaah!), then continue walking in its original direction once it hits ground again. As with falling, being bumped while digging has no effect, and being told to dig when falling or when there is no ground is ignored. (In other words, a walking Lemming can fall, dig, or switch directions. If more than one of these conditions are satisfied, fall has higher precedence than dig, which has higher precedence than switching directions.)\n// Although Lemmings can walk, fall, and dig, Lemmings aren't invulnerable. If a Lemming falls for too long then hits the ground, it can splatter. In particular, if a Lemming falls for more than 20 clock cycles then hits the ground, it will splatter and cease walking, falling, or digging (all 4 outputs become 0), forever (Or until the FSM gets reset). There is no upper limit on how far a Lemming can fall before hitting the ground.

In particular, if a Lemming is bumped on the left (by receiving a 1 on bump_left), it will walk right. If it's bumped on the right (by receiving a 1 on bump_right), it will walk left.
