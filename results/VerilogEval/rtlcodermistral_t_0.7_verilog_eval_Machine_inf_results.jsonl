Provide the Verilog code design directly.\n\n This Verilog module is a simple combinational logic circuit which implements a multiplexer. The module has five ports, four inputs and one output. The inputs are a clock signal (clk), a select signal (L), and two data inputs (q_in and r_in). The output is a single bit register (Q).  The module is triggered on the rising edge of the clock signal. When the clock signal is high, the logic circuit evaluates the select signal (L). If the select signal is high, the output register (Q) is set to the value of the second data input (r_in). If the select signal is low, the output register (Q) is set to the value of the first data input (q_in).  The initial value of the output register (Q) is set to 0. This ensures that the output register is in a known state before the first rising edge of the clock signal.  The module is useful for selecting between two data inputs based on a select signal.

Provide the Verilog code design directly.\n\n The top Verilog module is a finite state machine (FSM) with two states, A and B. It has five ports: clk, j, k, areset, and out. The clk and areset ports are both inputs, while j, k, and out are outputs. The clk port is used to synchronize the state transitions, while the areset port is used to reset the FSM to its initial state. The j and k ports are used to control the state transitions. The out port is used to indicate the current state of the FSM.   The FSM is implemented using a combinational always block, which is used to determine the next state based on the current state and the values of the j and k ports. If the current state is A, the next state is determined by the value of the j port. If the j port is high, the next state is B, otherwise it is A. Similarly, if the current state is B, the next state is determined by the value of the k port. If the k port is high, the next state is A, otherwise it is B.   The FSM is then implemented using a clocked always block, which is used to update the state of the FSM based on the value of the areset port and the value of the next state. If the areset port is high, the state is reset to A. Otherwise, the state is updated to the value of the next state.   Finally, the out port is used to indicate the current state of the FSM.

Provide the Verilog code design directly.\n\n This top Verilog module is a state machine that outputs a one-bit signal z. The module has four ports: a clock (clk), a reset (reset), an input (w), and an output (z). The module has six states, A to F. The next state of the state machine is determined by the current state and the input w. The transition from state A to state B is taken when the input w is low. The transition from state A to state A is taken when the input w is high. The transition from state B to state D is taken when the input w is high. The transition from state B to state C is taken when the input w is low. The transition from state C to state D is taken when the input w is high. The transition from state C to state E is taken when the input w is low. The transition from state D to state A is taken when the input w is high. The transition from state D to state F is taken when the input w is low. The transition from state E to state D is taken when the input w is high. The transition from state E to state E is taken when the input w is low. The transition from state F to state D is taken when the input w is high. The transition from state F to state C is taken when the input w is low.  The state machine is triggered by the clk signal. When the clk signal is high, the state machine will check the reset signal.

When the load input is high, the data input (data) is loaded into the output register (q).  The enable input (ena) is used to control the direction of the shift. When the enable input is set to 2'h1, the output register (q) is shifted to the left. When the enable input is set to 2'h2, the output register (q) is shifted to the right.  The data input (data) is used to provide the data to be shifted. The data input is a 100-bit wide vector.  The data output (q) is used to output the shifted data. The data output is a 100-bit wide vector.  The module is always triggered on the rising edge of the clock input (clk). When the load input is high, the data input (data) is loaded into the output register (q). When the enable input is set to 2'h1, the output register (q) is shifted to the left.

The top module is the module that is being tested.  \tThe top module contains two inputs, a clock and a reset. The clock is used to synchronize the logic of the module.

The data output is used to output the data that is being processed by the module, and the valid output is used to indicate when the data output is valid.  \tThe top module also contains two internal signals, a state and a counter. The state is used to keep track of the current state of the module, and the counter is used to keep track of the number of clock cycles that have passed since the last reset.  \tThe top module is a finite state machine (FSM). The FSM has four states: idle, wait, process, and done. The idle state is the initial state of the module, and is entered when the reset signal is asserted. In the idle state, the counter is reset to 0 and the data output is set to 0.  \tWhen the clock signal is asserted, the FSM transitions to the wait state. In the wait state, the counter is incremented and the data output is set to 0. The FSM remains in the wait state until the counter reaches a certain threshold, at which point it transitions to the process state.  \tIn the process state, the data output is set to the data that is being processed by the module.

In this state, the module checks the third bit of the input. If it is 0, the state machine remains in the BYTE1 state. If it is 1, the state machine transitions to the BYTE2 state.  In the BYTE2 state, the state machine transitions to the BYTE3 state. In the BYTE3 state, the state machine transitions to the DONE state.  In the DONE state, the module checks the third bit of the input again. If it is 0, the state machine transitions back to the BYTE1 state.

If the state is B and x is low, then the next state is B. If the state is B and x is high, then the next state is E. If the state is C and x is low, then the next state is C. If the state is C and x is high, then the next state is B. If the state is D and x is low, then the next state is B. If the state is D and x is high, then the next state is C. If the state is E and x is low, then the next state is D. If the state is E and x is high, then the next state is E.\n\nPlease complete the Verilog code below and return the complete module code.

Provide the Verilog code design directly.\n\n This top Verilog module is a state machine that outputs a one-bit signal z. The module has four ports: a clock (clk), a reset (reset), an input (w), and an output (z). The module has six states, A to F. The next state of the state machine is determined by the current state and the input w. The transition from state A to state B is taken when the input w is low. The transition from state A to state A is taken when the input w is high. The transition from state B to state D is taken when the input w is high. The transition from state B to state C is taken when the input w is low. The transition from state C to state D is taken when the input w is high. The transition from state C to state E is taken when the input w is low. The transition from state D to state A is taken when the input w is high. The transition from state D to state F is taken when the input w is low. The transition from state E to state D is taken when the input w is high. The transition from state E to state E is taken when the input w is low. The transition from state F to state D is taken when the input w is high. The transition from state F to state C is taken when the input w is low.  The state machine is triggered by the clk signal. When the clk signal is high, the state machine will check the reset signal. If the reset signal is high, the state machine will reset to state A, otherwise the state machine will transition to the next state. The output z is high when the state machine is in state E or F, and is low otherwise.\n\n\n\nPlease complete the Verilog code below and return the complete module code.

It has four ports: two inputs (ring and vibrate_mode) and two outputs (ringer and motor).   The ring input is a signal that is used to indicate when the device should be ringing or vibrating. The vibrate_mode input is a signal that indicates whether the device should be ringing or vibrating.   The ringer output is a signal that is used to control the ringer of the device. It is set to 1 when the device should be ringing and 0 when it should not be ringing. The motor output is a signal that is used to control the motor of the device. It is set to 1 when the device should be vibrating and 0 when it should not be vibrating.   The module uses two assign statements to control the ringer and motor outputs. The first assign statement sets the ringer output to the logical AND of the ring and the logical NOT of the vibrate_mode inputs. This means that the ringer output will be set to 1 when the ring input is 1 and the vibrate_mode input is 0, and it will be set to 0 otherwise.   The second assign statement sets the motor output to the logical AND of the ring and the vibrate_mode inputs. This means that the motor output will be set to 1 when both the ring input and the vibrate_mode input are 1, and it will be set to 0 otherwise.   This module is used to control the ringer and motor of a device based on the ring and vibrate_mode inputs. When the ring input is 1 and the vibrate_mode input is 0, the ringer output will be set to 1 and the motor output will be set to 0. When the ring input is 1 and the vibrate_mode input is 1, the ringer output will be set to 0 and the motor output will be set to 1.\nPlease complete the Verilog code below and return the complete module code.

The state machine is triggered by the clock signal, clk, and the input signal, in. The output signal, out, is set to 1 when the state machine is in state D. The state machine is reset to state A when the reset signal, areset, is triggered.   The state machine is implemented using a 2-bit register, state, and a combinational logic block. The combinational logic block is used to determine the next state of the state machine based on the current state and the input signal. The logic is as follows:   If the current state is A, then the next state will be B if the input signal is 1, and A if the input signal is 0.   If the current state is B, then the next state will be B if the input signal is 1, and C if the input signal is 0.

Provide the Verilog code design directly.\n\n The top Verilog module is a simple state machine with two states, A and B. It has four inputs: clk, in, reset, and out, and one output, out. The clk input is used to trigger the state machine, the in input is used to determine which state to transition to, the reset input is used to reset the state machine to the initial state, and the out output is used to indicate the current state.  The module is implemented using a parameterized register, state, and a combinational logic block. The parameterized register, state, is used to store the current state of the state machine. The combinational logic block is used to determine the next state of the state machine based on the current state and the in input. If the current state is A, the next state will be A if the in input is high, and B if the in input is low. If the current state is B, the next state will be B if the in input is high, and A if the in input is low.  The module also contains an always block triggered on the rising edge of the clk input. This block is used to update the state register with the next state determined by the combinational logic block. If the reset input is high, the state register is reset to the initial state, B. Otherwise, the state register is updated with the next state determined by the combinational logic block.  Finally, the out output is assigned the value of the state register.

The areset port is an input port that is used to reset the state machine to the initial state. The bump_left and bump_right ports are input ports that indicate whether the robot has bumped into an obstacle on the left or right side. The walk_left and walk_right ports are output ports that indicate the walking direction of the robot.  The module has two parameters, WL and WR, which represent the two states of the state machine.

The combinational logic block is used to determine the next state of the state machine based on the current state and the bump_left and bump_right inputs. If the current state is WL, the next state will be WR if the bump_left input is high, and WL if the bump_left input is low.

The module has four ports: a clock (clk), a reset (reset), an input (w), and an output (z). The module has six states, A to F. The next state of the state machine is determined by the current state and the input w. The transition from state A to state B is taken when the input w is low. The transition from state A to state A is taken when the input w is high. The transition from state B to state D is taken when the input w is high. The transition from state B to state C is taken when the input w is low. The transition from state C to state D is taken when the input w is high. The transition from state C to state E is taken when the input w is low. The transition from state D to state A is taken when the input w is high. The transition from state D to state F is taken when the input w is low. The transition from state E to state D is taken when the input w is high. The transition from state E to state E is taken when the input w is low. The transition from state F to state D is taken when the input w is high. The transition from state F to state C is taken when the input w is low.  The state machine is triggered by the clk signal. When the clk signal is high, the state machine will check the reset signal.

Provide the Verilog code design directly.\n\n This Verilog module is used to control the temperature of a room. It has two inputs, mode and fan_on, and three outputs, heater, aircon and fan. The inputs mode and fan_on are used to determine the state of the system, while the outputs heater, aircon and fan are used to control the temperature of the room.  The mode input is used to determine the mode of operation. If mode is high, the system is in heating mode and if mode is low, the system is in cooling mode.  The fan_on input is used to control the fan. If fan_on is high, the fan will be turned on regardless of the mode.  The too_cold and too_hot inputs are used to determine the temperature of the room. If too_cold is high, the room is too cold and if too_hot is high, the room is too hot.  The fan output is used to control the fan. If fan is high, the fan will be turned on. The fan will be turned on if either too_cold or too_hot is high, or if fan_on is high.  The heater output is used to control the heater. If heater is high, the heater will be turned on. The heater will be turned on if mode is high and too_cold is high.  The aircon output is used to control the air conditioner. If aircon is high, the air conditioner will be turned on.

Provide the Verilog code design directly.\n\n This top Verilog module is a state machine that controls the state of the data within a shift register. The module has 4 ports: a clock (clk), a reset (reset), a data input (data), and an output (start_shifting). The module has 5 states: S, S1, S11, S110, and Done. The module is implemented using a register, state, and a combinational logic block. The combinational logic block is used to determine the next state of the state machine based on the current state and the data input. If the current state is S, and the data input is high, then the next state will be S1. If the data input is low, the next state will be S. If the current state is S1, and the data input is high, the next state will be S11. If the data input is low, the next state will be S. If the current state is S11, and the data input is high, the next state will be S11. If the data input is low, the next state will be S110. If the current state is S110, and the data input is high, the next state will be Done. If the data input is low, the next state will be S. If the current state is Done, the next state will be Done.  The state machine is updated on the rising edge of the clk signal, and is reset to the initial state (S) on the rising edge of the reset signal.

The module has 6 ports: clk, areset, bump_left, bump_right, walk_left, and walk_right. The clk port is an input port that is used to synchronize the state machine. The areset port is an input port that is used to reset the state machine to the initial state. The bump_left and bump_right ports are input ports that indicate whether the robot has bumped into an obstacle on the left or right side. The walk_left and walk_right ports are output ports that indicate the walking direction of the robot.  The module has two parameters, WL and WR, which represent the two states of the state machine. The state machine is implemented using a register, state, and a combinational logic block. The combinational logic block is used to determine the next state of the state machine based on the current state and the bump_left and bump_right inputs. If the current state is WL, the next state will be WR if the bump_left input is high, and WL if the bump_left input is low. Similarly, if the current state is WR, the next state will be WL if the bump_right input is high, and WR if the bump_right input is low.  The state machine is updated on the rising edge of the clk signal, and is reset to the initial state (WL) on the rising edge of the areset signal.

The inputs are a clock signal (clk), a select signal (L), and two data inputs (q_in and r_in). The output is a single bit register (Q).  The module is triggered on the rising edge of the clock signal. When the clock signal is high, the logic circuit evaluates the select signal (L). If the select signal is high, the output register (Q) is set to the value of the second data input (r_in). If the select signal is low, the output register (Q) is set to the value of the first data input (q_in).  The initial value of the output register (Q) is set to 0. This ensures that the output register is in a known state before the first rising edge of the clock signal.  The module is useful for selecting between two data inputs based on a select signal.

Provide the Verilog code design directly.\n\n The top Verilog module is a finite state machine (FSM) with two states, A and B. It has five ports: clk, j, k, areset, and out. The clk and areset ports are both inputs, while j, k, and out are outputs. The clk port is used to synchronize the state transitions, while the areset port is used to reset the FSM to its initial state. The j and k ports are used to control the state transitions. The out port is used to indicate the current state of the FSM.   The FSM is implemented using a combinational always block, which is used to determine the next state based on the current state and the values of the j and k ports. If the current state is A, the next state is determined by the value of the j port. If the j port is high, the next state is B, otherwise it is A. Similarly, if the current state is B, the next state is determined by the value of the k port. If the k port is high, the next state is A, otherwise it is B.   The FSM is then implemented using a clocked always block, which is used to update the state of the FSM based on the value of the areset port and the value of the next state. If the areset port is high, the state is reset to A. Otherwise, the state is updated to the value of the next state.   Finally, the out port is used to indicate the current state of the FSM.

Provide the Verilog code design directly.\n\n This Verilog module implements a state machine with four states, A, B, C, and D. The state machine is triggered by the clock signal, clk, and the input signal, in. The output signal, out, is set to 1 when the state machine is in state D. The state machine is reset to state A when the reset signal, areset, is triggered.   The state machine is implemented using a 2-bit register, state, and a combinational logic block. The combinational logic block is used to determine the next state of the state machine based on the current state and the input signal. The logic is as follows:   If the current state is A, then the next state will be B if the input signal is 1, and A if the input signal is 0.   If the current state is B, then the next state will be B if the input signal is 1, and C if the input signal is 0.   If the current state is C, then the next state will be D if the input signal is 1, and A if the input signal is 0.   If the current state is D, then the next state will be B if the input signal is 1, and C if the input signal is 0.

The out_sop output is generated by taking the logical AND of input c and d, and then taking the logical OR of the result with the logical AND of the logical NOT of input a, the logical NOT of input b, and input c.   The out_pos output is generated by first taking the logical AND of inputs c, the logical OR of the logical NOT of input b and input d, and the logical OR of the logical NOT of input a and input b. This result is assigned to the wire pos0. Then, the same logical AND is done, but with the logical OR of the logical NOT of input a and input d. This result is assigned to the wire pos1. Finally, the out_pos output is assigned to the result of a ternary expression that checks if pos0 and pos1 are equal, and if so, assigns out_pos to pos0, otherwise assigns out_pos to 1'bx (unknown).\nPlease complete the Verilog code below and return the complete module code.

{"task_id": "fsm1s", "description": "You are a Verilog expert. Be concise and focused on the key points and avoid repetitive thoughts. Provide the Verilog code design directly.\n\n The top Verilog module is a simple state machine with two states, A and B. It has four inputs: clk, in, reset, and out, and one output, out. The clk input is used to trigger the state machine, the in input is used to determine which state to transition to, the reset input is used to reset the state machine to the initial state, and the out output is used to indicate the current state.  The module is implemented using a parameterized register, state, and a combinational logic block. The parameterized register, state, is used to store the current state of the state machine. The combinational logic block is used to determine the next state of the state machine based on the current state and the in input. If the current state is A, the next state will be A if the in input is high, and B if the in input is low. If the current state is B, the next state will be B if the in input is high, and A if the in input is low.  The module also contains an always block triggered on the rising edge of the clk input. This block is used to update the state register with the next state determined by the combinational logic block. If the reset input is high, the state register is reset to the initial state, B. Otherwise, the state register is updated with the next state determined by the combinational logic block.  Finally, the out output is assigned the value of the state register. If the state register is B, the out output will be high, otherwise it will be low.\nPlease complete the Verilog code below and return the complete module code.

When the clock signal goes from low to high, the output q is set to the inverse of the input a. This means that when the input a is high, the output q will be low and vice versa. The module will continuously update the output q whenever the clock signal changes from low to high.\nPlease complete the Verilog code below and return the complete module code.

The first input signal is a 100-bit wide vector, and the second input signal is the same vector shifted by one bit. The module has three output signals, out_both, out_any, and out_different.   The out_both signal is generated by performing a bit-wise AND operation between the two input signals. This will result in a 99-bit wide vector, where each bit is 1 only if both the corresponding bits of the two input signals are 1.  The out_any signal is generated by performing a bit-wise OR operation between the two input signals. This will result in a 100-bit wide vector, where each bit is 1 if either of the corresponding bits of the two input signals is 1.  The out_different signal is generated by performing a bit-wise XOR operation between the two input signals.

Provide the Verilog code design directly.\n\n This top module is a combinatorial module that adds up all the bits of the input signal \"in\" and stores the result in the output signal \"out\". The input signal \"in\" is a 255-bit wide vector, and the output signal \"out\" is an 8-bit wide vector.   The module contains an always_comb block, which is a type of block that is used to describe combinatorial logic. Inside the always_comb block, the output signal \"out\" is initialized to 0. Then, a for loop is used to iterate through all the bits of the input signal \"in\". For each bit, the value of \"out\" is incremented by the value of the corresponding bit in the input signal. After the for loop is finished, the output signal \"out\" will contain the sum of all the bits in the input signal.\nPlease complete the Verilog code below and return the complete module code.

Provide the Verilog code design directly.\n\n This Verilog module is used to control the temperature of a room. It has two inputs, mode and fan_on, and three outputs, heater, aircon and fan. The inputs mode and fan_on are used to determine the state of the system, while the outputs heater, aircon and fan are used to control the temperature of the room.  The mode input is used to determine the mode of operation. If mode is high, the system is in heating mode and if mode is low, the system is in cooling mode.  The fan_on input is used to control the fan. If fan_on is high, the fan will be turned on regardless of the mode.  The too_cold and too_hot inputs are used to determine the temperature of the room. If too_cold is high, the room is too cold and if too_hot is high, the room is too hot.  The fan output is used to control the fan. If fan is high, the fan will be turned on. The fan will be turned on if either too_cold or too_hot is high, or if fan_on is high.  The heater output is used to control the heater. If heater is high, the heater will be turned on. The heater will be turned on if mode is high and too_cold is high.  The aircon output is used to control the air conditioner. If aircon is high, the air conditioner will be turned on.

Provide the Verilog code design directly.\n\n This top Verilog module is a state machine that outputs a one-bit signal z. The module has four ports: a clock (clk), a reset (reset), an input (w), and an output (z). The module has six states, A to F. The next state of the state machine is determined by the current state and the input w. The transition from state A to state B is taken when the input w is low. The transition from state A to state A is taken when the input w is high. The transition from state B to state D is taken when the input w is high. The transition from state B to state C is taken when the input w is low. The transition from state C to state D is taken when the input w is high. The transition from state C to state E is taken when the input w is low. The transition from state D to state A is taken when the input w is high. The transition from state D to state F is taken when the input w is low. The transition from state E to state D is taken when the input w is high. The transition from state E to state E is taken when the input w is low. The transition from state F to state D is taken when the input w is high. The transition from state F to state C is taken when the input w is low.  The state machine is triggered by the clk signal. When the clk signal is high, the state machine will check the reset signal. If the reset signal is high, the state machine will reset to state A, otherwise the state machine will transition to the next state.

The areset port is an input port that is used to reset the state machine to the initial state. The bump_left and bump_right ports are input ports that indicate whether the robot has bumped into an obstacle on the left or right side. The walk_left and walk_right ports are output ports that indicate the walking direction of the robot.  The module has two parameters, WL and WR, which represent the two states of the state machine.

The combinational logic block is used to determine the next state of the state machine based on the current state and the bump_left and bump_right inputs. If the current state is WL, the next state will be WR if the bump_left input is high, and WL if the bump_left input is low. Similarly, if the current state is WR, the next state will be WL if the bump_right input is high, and WR if the bump_right input is low.

The port connections of the module are as follows: x is the 4-bit input, y is the 4-bit input, and sum is the 5-bit output. The module is a combinational logic circuit, meaning that the output is determined solely by the current inputs and not by any previous state. The module will take the two 4-bit inputs (x and y) and add them together to produce a 5-bit output (sum). The output will be the sum of the two inputs, with the most significant bit being the carry bit.\nPlease complete the Verilog code below and return the complete module code.

Provide the Verilog code design directly.\n\n This Verilog module is a state machine that has four states, A, B, C, and D. The input port 'in' is a single bit signal that is used to control the state transitions. The 'state' port is a two bit signal that is used to represent the current state of the state machine. The 'next_state' port is a two bit signal that is used to represent the next state of the state machine. The 'out' port is a single bit signal that is used to indicate when the state machine is in state D.   The always_comb block is used to define the state transitions. It uses a case statement to determine the next state of the state machine based on the current state and the value of the 'in' signal. If the current state is A and the 'in' signal is high, the next state is B. If the 'in' signal is low, the next state remains A. Similarly, if the current state is B and the 'in' signal is high, the next state is B. If the 'in' signal is low, the next state is C.

Provide the Verilog code design directly.\n\n The top Verilog module is a finite state machine (FSM) with two states, A and B. It has five ports: clk, j, k, areset, and out. The clk and areset ports are both inputs, while j, k, and out are outputs. The clk port is used to synchronize the state transitions, while the areset port is used to reset the FSM to its initial state. The j and k ports are used to control the state transitions. The out port is used to indicate the current state of the FSM.   The FSM is implemented using a combinational always block, which is used to determine the next state based on the current state and the values of the j and k ports. If the current state is A, the next state is determined by the value of the j port. If the j port is high, the next state is B, otherwise it is A. Similarly, if the current state is B, the next state is determined by the value of the k port. If the k port is high, the next state is A, otherwise it is B.   The FSM is then implemented using a clocked always block, which is used to update the state of the FSM based on the value of the areset port and the value of the next state. If the areset port is high, the state is reset to A. Otherwise, the state is updated to the value of the next state.   Finally, the out port is used to indicate the current state of the FSM.

The output is determined by the combination of the four inputs. The module uses a case statement to determine the output based on the combination of the four inputs.   For example, if the inputs a, b, c, and d are all 0, then the output out is 0. If the inputs a, b, c, and d are all 1, then the output out is 1. Similarly, if the inputs a, b, c, and d are 0, 1, 0, and 1 respectively, then the output out is 0. The module will produce the same output for any combination of the four inputs.   The module is implemented using an always block with a case statement. The case statement is used to map the four input combinations to the corresponding output. The inputs are combined into a 4-bit vector and used as the case statement selector. The output is assigned to the corresponding case statement.

The module has four ports: a clock (clk), a reset (reset), an input (w), and an output (z). The module has six states, A to F. The next state of the state machine is determined by the current state and the input w. The transition from state A to state B is taken when the input w is low. The transition from state A to state A is taken when the input w is high. The transition from state B to state D is taken when the input w is high. The transition from state B to state C is taken when the input w is low. The transition from state C to state D is taken when the input w is high. The transition from state C to state E is taken when the input w is low. The transition from state D to state A is taken when the input w is high. The transition from state D to state F is taken when the input w is low. The transition from state E to state D is taken when the input w is high. The transition from state E to state E is taken when the input w is low. The transition from state F to state D is taken when the input w is high. The transition from state F to state C is taken when the input w is low.  The state machine is triggered by the clk signal. When the clk signal is high, the state machine will check the reset signal.

{"task_id": "review2015_fsmseq", "description": "You are a Verilog expert. Be concise and focused on the key points and avoid repetitive thoughts. Provide the Verilog code design directly.\n\n This top Verilog module is a state machine that controls the state of the data within a shift register. The module has 4 ports: a clock (clk), a reset (reset), a data input (data), and an output (start_shifting). The module has 5 states: S, S1, S11, S110, and Done. The module is implemented using a register, state, and a combinational logic block. The combinational logic block is used to determine the next state of the state machine based on the current state and the data input. If the current state is S, and the data input is high, then the next state will be S1. If the data input is low, the next state will be S. If the current state is S1, and the data input is high, the next state will be S11. If the data input is low, the next state will be S. If the current state is S11, and the data input is high, the next state will be S11. If the data input is low, the next state will be S110. If the current state is S110, and the data input is high, the next state will be Done. If the data input is low, the next state will be S. If the current state is Done, the next state will be Done.  The state machine is updated on the rising edge of the clk signal, and is reset to the initial state (S) on the rising edge of the reset signal. The output of the state machine is assigned based on the current state of the state machine. The output will be high if the state is Done, and low otherwise.\n\n\n\nPlease complete the Verilog code below and return the complete module code.

The clk port is an input port that is used to synchronize the register. The reset port is an input port that is used to reset the register to the initial value. The q port is an output port that is used to output the value of the register. The module has two registers, q and q_next. The q_next register stores the next value of the register. The q register is updated on the rising edge of the clk signal. If the reset port is high, the register is reset to the initial value, 32'h1. Otherwise, the q register is updated with the value stored in the q_next register. The q_next register is updated on every clock cycle, and stores the value of the q register shifted by 1 bit. If the value of the q register is shifted out of bit 0, it is sent back to bit 31. Bits 21 and 1 are XORed with the value of bit 0.
